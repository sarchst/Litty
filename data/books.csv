9780385550369,James,,"The decision to escape changes everything. Jim faces an impossible choice: accept being sold away from his family or risk everything for freedom. His flight to Jackson Island intersects with Huck Finn's own desperate escape from an abusive father, setting both on a perilous river journey that will test every assumption about survival, loyalty, and what it means to be free.

This bold reimagining shifts the entire narrative lens. Jim emerges not as a secondary figure but as a fully realized protagonist whose wit, courage, and moral complexity drive the story forward. The familiar landmarks of Twain's original—treacherous weather, unexpected allies and enemies, the con men Duke and Dauphin—take on new meaning when filtered through Jim's perspective and agency.

Everett masterfully balances devastating social critique with moments of sharp humor, creating a work that both honors and fundamentally challenges its literary predecessor. The result interrogates the very foundations of American storytelling, asking who gets to be the hero of their own narrative and what voices have been silenced in our most celebrated tales.","Everett reimagines Huckleberry Finn from Jim's perspective, transforming literature's most problematic friendship into something honest and profound.

9780812993547,Between the World and Me,Notes on the First 150 Years in America,"Ta-Nehisi Coates sits down to write his teenage son a letter about what it means to navigate America in a Black body. This correspondence becomes something far more expansive—a reckoning with centuries of violence, exploitation, and systemic racism that continues to shape contemporary life.

Drawing from his own intellectual awakening and lived experiences across different landscapes—from university halls to urban neighborhoods, from historical sites to the homes of grieving families—Coates constructs a framework for understanding how racial mythology has been foundational to American society. His personal journey of discovery becomes a lens through which to examine how this mythology continues to manifest in police violence, mass incarceration, and the ongoing devaluation of Black lives.

The result is an unflinching examination of American racial dynamics that refuses easy consolation or false hope. Instead, it offers clear-eyed analysis rooted in historical understanding and paternal love, creating space for honest conversation about the realities his son will inherit and navigate.","Coates writes to his teenage son about inhabiting a Black body in America, weaving personal narrative with historical analysis.

His mother Leonie struggles with her own demons, including drug addiction and the weight of an interracial relationship in the South. She's haunted by visions of her deceased brother, a connection that brings both solace and torment.

The family's journey to collect Michael from Mississippi's infamous Parchman penitentiary becomes a reckoning with generational trauma and the lingering wounds of racial violence. Along the way, Jojo encounters the spirit of another young boy—a former inmate whose story illuminates the prison's dark legacy and the cyclical nature of suffering that has shaped the region.

Through multiple perspectives, the novel examines how the past refuses to stay buried, how family bonds can both sustain and suffocate, and how young people inherit the unresolved pain of previous generations. The supernatural elements serve as a bridge between historical injustice and contemporary struggle, revealing how trauma echoes across time and bloodlines.",Thirteen-year-old Jojo navigates a family road trip to pick up his father from Mississippi's notorious Parchman prison.

Matthew Desmond's immersive investigation reveals a system where displacement has become profitable, trapping vulnerable tenants in an endless cycle of instability.

Living alongside his subjects in neglected neighborhoods, Desmond captures the impossible calculations families make daily—choosing between medicine and rent, heat and groceries. These aren't isolated tragedies but symptoms of a larger machine that extracts wealth from those who can least afford it. Children switch schools repeatedly, parents lose jobs due to constant moves, and entire communities fracture under the weight of perpetual uncertainty.

This isn't merely an exposé of individual hardship but an examination of how America's housing crisis manufactures and sustains poverty. Desmond connects the dots between policy failures and personal devastation, showing how the absence of stable shelter undermines every other aspect of human flourishing. The result challenges readers to reconsider fundamental assumptions about economic mobility and the true cost of inequality in contemporary America.","Following eight Milwaukee families through eviction court and precarious rentals, Desmond shows how housing instability isn't just a symptom of poverty—it's a cause.

Moving from small-town America to the corridors of European power to the mountains of Afghanistan, the book interrogates the cost of assimilation and the weight of inherited trauma. Financial ruin shadows working families while Wall Street prospers, immigrants face mounting hostility, and America's foreign interventions create new cycles of violence.

9780385521314,Say Nothing,A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland,"A mother of ten vanishes from her Belfast home in 1972, dragged away in front of her children during one of Northern Ireland's darkest periods. Decades later, when her remains surface on a remote beach, the discovery reopens wounds that an entire community had tried to bury.

Keefe transforms this single disappearance into a lens through which to examine the complex web of violence, loyalty, and betrayal that defined the Northern Irish conflict. The narrative weaves between bomb-makers who risked everything for their cause, intelligence operatives playing deadly games of cat and mouse, and political figures who later rewrote their own histories when peace negotiations began.

This investigation reveals how a society torn apart by guerrilla warfare continues to grapple with questions of justice and memory. The book captures the moral ambiguity faced by those who lived through the conflict—former fighters questioning whether their actions served a noble cause or simply perpetuated cycles of revenge, and survivors struggling to find meaning in their losses.

Through intimate portraits of both perpetrators and victims, the story illuminates how political violence reshapes entire communities, leaving scars that persist long after the guns fall silent.","Using one notorious killing as its foundation, Keefe excavates the brutal history of the Troubles and its lasting wounds.

Thomas Cromwell recognizes opportunity in the king's growing frustration. With Katherine of Aragon's death removing the last obstacle to a clean slate, Cromwell begins weaving the intricate plot that will eliminate Anne from the chessboard of Tudor politics. As Jane Seymour quietly positions herself as the next queen, Anne discovers that her intelligence and fierce independence—her greatest strengths—have become liabilities in a world where survival depends on submission.

Carter's audacious gamble to isolate Begin and Sadat from outside pressures created a pressure cooker of diplomacy that teetered between breakthrough and collapse.

Wright reconstructs this extraordinary diplomatic marathon, tracking how religious convictions, personal grudges, and political survival instincts shaped every conversation. The author reveals how Carter's Methodist faith clashed and connected with Begin's Orthodox Judaism and Sadat's Islamic worldview, creating unexpected moments of understanding amid bitter disagreements.

The narrative captures the human drama behind closed doors—Begin's theatrical outbursts, Sadat's calculated charm, Carter's relentless mediation—while examining the broader forces that had kept the region locked in conflict.

Isabel Wilkerson transforms this massive demographic shift into an intimate chronicle by following three individuals whose personal odysseys illuminate the broader experience.

Meet Ida Mae Gladney, who traded Mississippi sharecropping for Chicago's promise in 1937. Follow George Starling's 1945 escape from Florida's citrus groves to New York's streets. Witness Robert Foster's cross-country drive from Louisiana to California in 1953, chasing dreams of medical practice without racial barriers.

Their stories expose both the violence they fled and the discrimination they encountered in supposedly welcoming destinations.

9780307592835,A Visit from the Goon Squad,,"Music becomes the thread connecting disparate lives in this innovative novel that jumps between eras and perspectives. At its center are two figures: a record industry veteran grappling with his fading relevance, and a kleptomaniac assistant whose stealing habit masks deeper wounds. But their story expands into a rich tapestry of interconnected characters whose lives span from the raw energy of 1970s punk clubs to a technology-saturated future.

Egan constructs her narrative like a playlist, with each chapter offering a different voice and timeline. The novel examines how music shapes identity and memory, following characters as they navigate the gap between youthful dreams and adult compromises. Some chase fame that proves hollow, others find unexpected redemption in small moments of grace.

What emerges is a meditation on aging, ambition, and the ways our past selves echo through time. The experimental structure mirrors the fragmented nature of memory itself, creating a reading experience that feels both intellectually ambitious and emotionally resonant. This is fiction that captures how the songs of our youth continue to play in the background of our lives, even as everything else changes.","Interconnected stories spanning decades follow aging punk rocker Bennie and his troubled employee Sasha, plus a host of other characters whose lives intersect.

9780802125088,The Yellow House,A Memoir,"A shotgun house in New Orleans East becomes the unlikely narrator of a century of American dreams deferred and family resilience tested. Sarah M. Broom excavates the layers of memory, neglect, and love embedded in the walls where she grew up—a structure that sheltered twelve siblings but couldn't protect them from the forces of urban decay and institutional abandonment.

This isn't simply a story about Hurricane Katrina's destruction, though that catastrophe looms large. Instead, Broom traces how systemic inequality slowly eroded her neighborhood long before the storm arrived. She examines the weight of place on identity, the way geography shapes destiny, and how families create meaning within spaces the outside world has written off.

Broom's narrative moves between intimate family portraits and broader questions about who gets to call a place home in America. Her mother's fierce determination to hold their world together becomes both inspiring and heartbreaking as the house itself seems to resist her efforts. The result is a meditation on belonging that challenges romantic notions of New Orleans while honoring the complex reality of those who built lives in its overlooked corners.","A transformative memoir about family, place, and the inexorable pull of home, centered on a shotgun house in New Orleans East.

The aftermath proves equally devastating. Criminal investigations target healthcare workers, questioning whether their actions during those catastrophic days crossed the line from mercy into murder. Fink's exhaustive investigation reveals the complex web of circumstances that led to these tragic choices.

Elena has circled back to her origins after building a life elsewhere—marriage, motherhood, and literary success in Florence couldn't keep her from returning to Naples and the love that has endured across decades.

Meanwhile, Lila remains entrenched in the very world both women once dreamed of escaping. Her business acumen has brought wealth but also dangerous entanglements with the corruption and violence that plague their old neighborhood. Despite—or perhaps because of—her refusal to leave, she has emerged as an influential figure in a community that both shaped and scarred her.

The novel examines how these two brilliant women, now in their sixties, reckon with the paths they've chosen and the dreams they've abandoned. Their relationship, forged in childhood and tested by rivalry, betrayal, and divergent destinies, remains the most enduring constant in lives marked by profound transformation.

Ron Hubbard, whose personal struggles and creative ambitions gave birth to an entirely new belief system, and David Miscavige, the young successor who inherited control of a sprawling organization. Wright methodically unpacks the institution's elaborate belief structure, its aggressive pursuit of Hollywood stars, and the dedicated followers who commit their lives through extraordinary contracts spanning centuries.

What begins as personal worry evolves into something far more expansive. Biss examines how we think about protection and vulnerability, both as individuals and as a society. She traces the stories we tell ourselves about contamination and safety, drawing connections between literary works, scientific history, and contemporary anxieties.

Through conversations with fellow mothers and deep dives into cultural texts, she uncovers the complex web of beliefs surrounding medical intervention and bodily autonomy. Her investigation reveals how individual choices ripple outward, affecting entire communities in ways we rarely consider.

This isn't simply a book about vaccines—it's an exploration of how fear shapes our decisions and how those decisions bind us together.

9780679405078,The Passage of Power,The Years of Lyndon Johnson,"This biographical masterpiece captures Lyndon Johnson during six pivotal years that defined both his legacy and America's trajectory. Johnson enters this period as an unrivaled master of Senate politics, yet his presidential ambitions crumble when the Democratic nomination slips to the younger, more charismatic Kennedy.

What follows reveals the brutal realities of political hierarchy. Johnson finds himself stripped of influence, relegated to a ceremonial role that offers neither the power he craved nor the respect he demanded. The Kennedy inner circle treats him as an outsider, while Robert Kennedy wages a personal campaign to diminish his standing.

Then November 22, 1963 changes everything. In an instant, Johnson must navigate the most challenging transition in American political history—assuming leadership of a traumatized nation while working with a staff that viewed him as an interloper. Yet this moment of crisis becomes his greatest triumph. Johnson transforms grief and uncertainty into legislative momentum, pushing through landmark civil rights measures and launching an ambitious campaign against poverty that reshapes the federal government's role in American life.

This volume illuminates how personal ambition, political genius, and historical circumstance converged to create one of the most consequential presidencies in modern American history.","Caro's masterful fourth volume chronicles Johnson's transformation from powerless Vice President to commanding President following Kennedy's assassination.

9781476716763,The Candy House,,"Tech entrepreneur Bix Bouton discovers the ultimate digital innovation through an unlikely encounter with academics studying memory externalization. His breakthrough spawns ""Own Your Unconscious,"" a technology that transforms how humanity experiences the past by making every forgotten moment retrievable and shareable.

This memory revolution fractures society into opposing factions: those who mine personal data for profit and others who recognize the devastating cost of surrendering mental privacy. Through this speculative lens, Egan examines how digital advancement threatens the very essence of human intimacy.

The novel's structure mirrors its themes, employing wildly diverse storytelling methods—from collective narration to social media fragments—that demonstrate how technology fragments our ways of communicating and understanding each other. Each narrative experiment reveals new dimensions of characters struggling to maintain genuine relationships in an increasingly surveilled world.

9781400052172,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,,"In 1951, a young African American woman died of cervical cancer in Baltimore, leaving behind five children and a legacy she never could have imagined. Doctors had harvested cells from Henrietta Lacks without her consent, and those cells defied every biological rule—they multiplied endlessly in laboratory conditions where all other human cells died.

These remarkable cells became the backbone of countless medical breakthroughs, from polio vaccines to cancer treatments to fertility research. They generated billions in profits for pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Yet for decades, the Lacks family lived in poverty, unaware that their mother's biological material was revolutionizing medicine worldwide.

Journalist Rebecca Skloot spent years investigating this story, forming deep bonds with Henrietta's children as they grappled with profound questions about medical ethics, racial inequality, and scientific progress. The result examines how one woman's cells transformed modern medicine while highlighting the complex intersection of race, class, and medical research in America.

Her existence splits between virtual validation and mounting anxiety as she becomes convinced that countless digital voices are reshaping her very thoughts.

The internet becomes both sanctuary and prison, a space where meaning fractures into endless fragments of images and references that defy comprehension. Climate catastrophe, economic uncertainty, and widespread isolation form the backdrop of this hyperconnected yet profoundly disconnected world.

Then reality intrudes with devastating clarity: urgent messages from her mother signal a family emergency that cannot be reduced to posts or pixels. The collision between her online persona and this intimate crisis forces a reckoning with what remains genuinely human in an age of digital saturation.

Lockwood constructs a narrative that mirrors our contemporary moment—fragmented yet unified, absurd yet deeply felt. This exploration of modern consciousness questions whether authentic connection can survive in a landscape designed for performance, ultimately revealing how love persists even within the chaos of our networked existence.","When a social media celebrity's hyper-online existence collides with a devastating family crisis, she must navigate between the absurd digital void and raw human connection.

As one discovers her calling in poetry and music while the other finds his artistic voice through the camera lens, they navigate the vibrant underground scene that pulses through the city's most legendary venues and neighborhoods.

Their shared journey takes them from the margins of society into the heart of an artistic revolution, where they encounter the era's most influential cultural figures. Living on dreams and determination, they support each other through poverty and uncertainty while the world around them transforms through social upheaval and creative experimentation.

This intimate account captures both the exhilaration of artistic discovery and the bittersweet nature of relationships that shape us. Set against the backdrop of a city in constant flux, it reveals how two young people's promise to protect and inspire one another became the catalyst for their eventual emergence as significant artists in their own right.",Smith's memoir chronicles her extraordinary friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe during their bohemian years in 1970s New York.

—Janet Maslin, The New York Times

""Just Kids concerns the early years of their passionate friendship, a time that coincided with the beginning of the end of Manhattan's last great bohemian age, when a couple with dreams of beatnik glory could live on day-old bread and cigarettes and paint fumes, all of which Smith evokes so precisely that one can smell the Nescafé boiling on a hot plate...More than a 1970s bohemian rhapsody, Just Kids is one of the best books ever written on becoming an artist— not the race for online celebrity and corporate sponsorship that often passes for artistic success these days, but the far more powerful, often difficult journey toward the ecstatic experience of capturing radiance of imagination on a page or stage or photographic paper. Jesus may have died for somebody's sins, but Patti Smith lives and writes and sings for all of us.""

""The reckless, splendid circus of New York's royal bohemia in the 1960s and '70s—rock idols, cowboy poets, Warhol Superstars—surrounds Smith in her heady recounting of a halcyon era. But the heart of Just Kids, a captivating memoir, is the lifelong love affair (first romantic, later creative and platonic) between Smith and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, before she became music's punk poet laureate and he one of the art world's most provocative and controversial figures. In her inimitable, lyrical style, Patti Smith recalls the pair's coming together as young, monumentally broke dreamers: ''just kids.'' What follows is both a poignant requiem (Mapplethorpe died of AIDS at age 43) and a radiant celebration of life.""

James McBride crafts a rich tapestry of voices—residents grappling with urban upheaval, law enforcement navigating racial tensions, congregants wrestling with faith, and local crime families protecting their territory. Each character carries secrets and sorrows that gradually surface as the neighborhood reels from the aftermath.

The novel excavates the complex social dynamics of late 1960s New York, where different worlds collide within the same few city blocks.

Her family's extreme self-reliance meant education was viewed with suspicion, and dangerous family dynamics went unchecked.

At seventeen, Westover had never sat in a classroom, but watching a brother escape to university planted a seed of possibility. Her pursuit of learning became an act of rebellion that would carry her from the mountains of Idaho to the halls of Harvard and Cambridge. Yet each step toward knowledge created an ever-widening chasm between her and the family she loved.

This memoir examines the price of transformation and the complex loyalties that bind us to our origins. Westover grapples with fundamental questions about identity, belonging, and whether it's possible to honor both the person you've become and the people who shaped you. Her story illuminates how education can be both liberation and loss—opening new worlds while closing doors to old ones.","An unforgettable memoir about a young woman who leaves her survivalist family to pursue education, eventually earning a PhD from Cambridge University.

Yet amid this terror, the regime commits an unthinkable crime—systematically kidnapping pregnant women, murdering them after childbirth, and distributing their babies to families within the military apparatus.

Faced with the double tragedy of losing both daughters and grandchildren, a determined group of grandmothers refuses to accept silence as survival. The Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo emerges as an unlikely resistance force, transforming grief into action. These women become amateur spies, trailing suspected families and gathering evidence. They pressure diplomats, challenge officials, and collaborate with scientists to develop revolutionary DNA testing methods.

Their search transcends mere family reunion—it becomes a battle over truth itself. Each recovered child represents a crack in the regime's carefully constructed lies. As democracy eventually returns to Argentina, the Abuelas' mission continues, raising profound questions about identity, belonging, and the stories we tell ourselves about family.

This meticulously researched account illuminates how ordinary people can dismantle systems of oppression through sheer persistence, revealing the power of maternal love to challenge state-sponsored terror.","During Argentina's military dictatorship, hundreds of babies were stolen from disappeared mothers and given to other families.

Jane Franklin, his youngest sister, exchanged more letters with the founding father than anyone else in his circle, yet her voice has been silenced by centuries of neglect.

Jill Lepore reconstructs Jane's remarkable life from recently unearthed documents, revealing a woman whose intellectual gifts rivaled her famous brother's. Jane possessed the same curiosity, wit, and political acumen that made Benjamin legendary, but social constraints of colonial America trapped her talents within domestic boundaries. While he shaped nations, she raised twelve children—two vastly different paths that illuminate the rigid gender roles of their era.

This biography does far more than rescue one woman from historical obscurity.

The result challenges conventional narratives about America's founding generation, revealing how gender, class, and circumstance determined whose stories survived and whose disappeared into silence.","Jill Lepore resurrects the forgotten story of Benjamin Franklin's youngest sister Jane, a brilliant woman confined by her era.

Yong unveils astonishing truths about familiar creatures: a crocodile's armored skin contains nerve endings more delicate than human fingertips, while massive squid have evolved enormous eyes specifically to spot the bioluminescent glow of whales in the deep ocean. Even seemingly silent gardens pulse with acoustic dramas as insects court potential mates through vibrations we cannot detect.

Blending scientific rigor with infectious curiosity, this book transforms our understanding of the natural world. Readers will never again look at a flower without wondering what secret patterns bees perceive, or walk past a dog without marveling at the rich tapestry of scents that guide its every step. Yong demonstrates that extraordinary sensory experiences exist all around us—we simply lack the biological equipment to perceive them.","Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Ed Yong takes us beyond human perception to experience the world through animal senses.

Their son rebels by embracing everything his parents oppose, moving next door to live with conservative neighbors. Walter abandons his principles, trading environmental advocacy for a paycheck from the coal industry. Patty transforms from the neighborhood's beloved figure into someone barely recognizable, her anger spilling over into public spectacle.

Franzen dissects the American middle class through this family's spectacular implosion, revealing how personal desires clash with moral aspirations. The novel examines what happens to idealistic people confronting the messy realities of marriage, parenthood, and compromise. Through the Berglunds' story, larger questions emerge about consumer culture, political disillusionment, and the price of living in a society that promises unlimited choice while delivering unexpected consequences.

9781668094716,Mother Mary Comes to Me,,"In this deeply personal memoir, Arundhati Roy confronts the labyrinthine bond with her deceased mother Mary—a relationship that defied easy categorization. Following her mother's death, Roy finds herself grappling with grief that surprises her in its ferocity, prompting a literary excavation of their shared history.

The narrative spans from Roy's youth in Kerala, where her determined mother established a school as a single parent, to Roy's emergence as an internationally acclaimed novelist and fearless political commentator. This isn't a conventional tribute to maternal love, but rather an unflinching examination of how formative relationships can be simultaneously nurturing and suffocating.

Roy's characteristic blend of lyrical prose and sharp observation illuminates the contradictions inherent in family bonds—the way we must sometimes create distance to preserve love, and how our most challenging relationships often prove most transformative. The memoir reveals how a complicated childhood in India's social and political landscape forged Roy's distinctive voice as both storyteller and activist, offering readers an intimate portrait of artistic development intertwined with personal reckoning.","Roy excavates her complicated relationship with her late mother in this raw, luminous memoir.

9780593597033,North Woods,,"A single dwelling deep in New England's wilderness serves as the stage for an ambitious chronicle spanning multiple centuries. Daniel Mason traces the lives of diverse inhabitants who call this remote place home, from colonial refugees seeking sanctuary to modern-day journalists uncovering buried mysteries.

Each generation leaves its mark on both the land and the narrative itself, creating an intricate tapestry of human experience. The forest witnesses acts of devotion and betrayal, moments of profound solitude and unexpected connection. As decades pass, the boundaries between civilization and wilderness blur, revealing how place shapes identity and how the past continues to influence the present.

Mason crafts a meditation on belonging and impermanence, examining how stories survive long after their protagonists have vanished. The novel questions whether we truly disappear or simply transform into something else—memory, legend, or the very soil beneath our feet. Through shifting perspectives and evolving language, this ambitious work demonstrates how individual lives interweave across time, creating patterns both beautiful and mysterious.",One house in the New England woods becomes home to centuries of inhabitants—from Puritan lovers to con men to wild creatures.

Dickie abandons his failing business to construct an underground bunker, convinced that preparing for doomsday beats confronting his mounting debts. Meanwhile, Imelda quietly liquidates her possessions online, hoping to salvage what's left of their stability. Their daughter Cass drowns her academic pressures in alcohol, while young PJ dreams of escaping the chaos entirely.

Murray examines how catastrophe doesn't arrive all at once—it accumulates through seemingly insignificant choices and chance encounters. A moment's kindness to a stranger, an unexpected patch of black ice, or even something as small as an insect caught in bridal lace might set irreversible forces in motion. The novel questions whether our lives follow predetermined paths or if we retain the power to redirect our stories even after disaster strikes.

Through interconnected timelines, Murray reveals how the Barnes family's current troubles connect to pivotal moments from their past, creating a meditation on fate, responsibility, and resilience. The result is both achingly funny and deeply compassionate—a story about ordinary people discovering whether redemption remains possible when everything they've built crumbles around them.","The Barnes family faces financial ruin and personal collapse in this darkly comic exploration of how single moments can derail entire lives.

9781608198061,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?,A Memoir,"The inevitable role reversal between parent and child takes center stage in this innovative graphic memoir that transforms one of life's most difficult passages into art. Roz Chast chronicles the final chapter of her parents' lives with a blend of visual storytelling and raw honesty that makes the unbearable somehow bearable.

What begins as a family crisis—her mother's dangerous attempt to retrieve items from an overstuffed closet—becomes the catalyst for confronting decades of avoidance. Chast finds herself responsible for two people she's spent a lifetime trying to understand: a father whose anxiety mirrors her own as dementia takes hold, and a domineering mother whose fierce independence must finally yield to necessity.

Through her distinctive artistic lens, Chast transforms the mundane horrors of institutional care, the awkwardness of physical dependency, and the guilt of hiring strangers into something approaching grace. Her cartoons capture what prose alone cannot: the absurdity that coexists with grief, the way love persists despite exasperation, and how humor becomes a survival mechanism when facing the unthinkable.","New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast chronicles her parents' final years in this groundbreaking graphic memoir.

Brian Goldstone follows five families navigating this impossible landscape, where full-time work no longer guarantees shelter.

Their stories unfold across a city transforming itself—Maurice and Natalia arrive seeking opportunity after Washington DC becomes unaffordable, while Kara balances hospital shifts with entrepreneurial ambitions. Britt celebrates securing a housing voucher, Michelle pursues social work training, and Celeste endures warehouse labor while battling cancer. Each family represents thousands more facing identical struggles in America's fastest-growing metropolitan areas.

Goldstone documents the daily rhythms of displacement—children completing homework in hotel rooms, parents maintaining professional appearances after sleepless nights in vehicles, families cycling between temporary shelters and unstable accommodations. His reporting reveals how housing instability ripples through every aspect of life, from education to healthcare to employment itself. The book challenges fundamental assumptions about poverty, work, and worthiness in contemporary America, arguing that stable housing must be reconsidered as essential infrastructure rather than market commodity.",Five Atlanta families with full-time jobs face homelessness in America's booming cities.

The boundaries of their confined world have shaped his understanding of reality since birth. His mother has carefully constructed routines, games, and explanations that transform their imprisonment into something resembling normalcy.

Yet beneath this protective facade lies a darker truth that Jack cannot fully grasp. His mother's sacrifice runs deeper than he realizes—she has spent years crafting an entire universe within impossible constraints. As Jack grows older and more inquisitive, the carefully maintained illusion begins to strain.

Donoghue examines how love can flourish even in the most desperate circumstances, and how a parent's devotion can create meaning where none should exist. The novel questions what we consider reality and home, while revealing the extraordinary lengths to which people will go to protect those they cherish. Through Jack's innocent perspective, readers encounter a story that challenges assumptions about survival, family, and the power of human connection to transcend even the most horrific situations.","Five-year-old Jack believes the tiny room where he lives with Ma is the entire world.

Alice, a young book editor in New York, becomes romantically involved with Ezra Blazer, a celebrated author decades her senior. Their relationship unfolds against the backdrop of the early Iraq War, capturing both the tenderness of an unlikely romance and the professional awakening of an aspiring writer.

The narrative then pivots to follow Amar, an Iraqi-American academic who finds himself detained by immigration officials at London's Heathrow Airport. Confined to a holding room over a December weekend in 2008, he contemplates his identity, family ties, and the circumstances that led him there as he attempts to reach his brother in Kurdistan.

What emerges is a sophisticated meditation on disparity—the gaps between cultures, generations, and circumstances that both divide and connect us. Halliday weaves these threads together with remarkable precision, building toward revelations that reframe everything that came before. The result is a novel that questions not only how we relate to one another across lines of difference, but how stories themselves function as bridges between seemingly incompatible worlds.","Two seemingly unconnected stories—a young editor's affair with a famous older writer, and an Iraqi-American man detained at Heathrow—reveal unexpected connections in this inventive exploration of power, privilege, and storytelling.",288,,Fiction / Literary,Simon & Schuster,06/02/2018,Lisa Halliday,"Lisa Halliday spent her childhood in Medfield, Massachusetts and now makes her home in Milan, Italy.

9780593493762,I Heard Her Call My Name,A Memoir of Transition,"Identity can be a labyrinth where we lose ourselves for decades, constructing elaborate personas that feel foreign even to us. Lucy Sante spent sixty years navigating this maze, moving from her Belgian Catholic upbringing to the vibrant chaos of 1970s New York, where she found artistic community among writers and bohemians who would either burn out spectacularly or achieve unexpected fame.

Yet even as Sante built a distinguished literary career, something fundamental remained unresolved—a persistent sense of living behind a mask. Her memoir weaves together the story of her creative evolution with the more recent revelation that finally brought her into focus: her gender transition. With characteristic wit and unflinching honesty, she examines the awkward beauty of learning to inhabit her true self, acknowledging the steep learning curve of embracing womanhood later in life.

This is both a love letter to New York's creative underground and a meditation on the courage required to stop performing and start living authentically.","An iconic writer's lapidary memoir of pursuing artistic truth while evading the truth of her own gender identity.

Ford's memoir traces a young Black woman's journey through adolescence while carrying an impossible burden: the mythology she's built around an absent father. Raised in poverty, Ashley has crafted an elaborate fantasy about the man she barely remembers, imagining him as a kindred spirit who shares her sensitivity and artistic nature.

This idealized relationship becomes her anchor through the turbulence of growing up—navigating financial hardship, a complicated dynamic with her mother, and the unwanted attention her developing body attracts. Ashley's desperate need for unconditional love leads her into a relationship that ends in sexual assault, a trauma she carries alone.

The revelation of her father's crimes shatters the careful illusion she's maintained, forcing Ashley to confront not just his reality, but her own. Ford examines how children of incarcerated parents create narratives to fill the void, and how those stories both sustain and betray us. Her memoir illuminates the particular challenges facing young Black women coming of age in circumstances that offer few safe spaces for vulnerability or growth.","Growing up poor and Black, Ashley clings to an idealized image of her incarcerated father—until devastating revelations force her to reckon with family, trauma, and survival.

Their father abandons them for a new life, while their mother channels her anguish into activism for missing children. Cassandra, now grown, carries the trauma differently—she spots her dead brother in crowded restaurants, on busy trains, aging naturally as if he'd never left this world.

These phantom sightings blur the boundaries between memory and reality until Cassandra encounters a stranger whose name stops her cold: Wayne. This mysterious figure seems to be conducting his own search, hunting for someone from his past while trying to understand his place in the present.

Serpell crafts a meditation on how loss reshapes our perception of the world around us. The novel interrogates the strange mathematics of grief—how the dead continue growing older in our minds, how we reconstruct the missing pieces of our lives through wishful thinking and desperate hope. What emerges is a story that bends between psychological realism and something more ethereal, examining the double vision that trauma creates and our endless capacity for self-deception in the face of unbearable absence.","When twelve-year-old Cassandra loses her brother in a tragic accident, grief fractures her family and reshapes her reality.

The family's increasingly violent attempts to restore order reveal the suffocating expectations that have shaped her life.

Han Kang crafts a surreal examination of bodily autonomy and psychological freedom, where the boundaries between sanity and madness blur under pressure.

Rose, facing the devastating sale of her young daughter Ashley in 1850s South Carolina, hastily fills this humble bag with whatever precious items she can gather—a mother's final gesture before their family is shattered by the slave trade.

Generations later, Ashley's granddaughter Ruth transforms this same sack into something extraordinary: a canvas for embroidered words that capture their family's journey through bondage and into uncertain freedom. Historian Tiya Miles follows these fragmented traces, weaving together material evidence, landscapes, and cultural artifacts to illuminate lives that traditional historical records systematically ignored.

This innovative approach to historical recovery reveals how enslaved families maintained connections and preserved their humanity despite systems designed to erase them. Miles demonstrates how objects can speak when voices have been silenced, creating a methodology that honors both scholarly rigor and the creative resilience of those who refused to let their stories disappear entirely.",A historian uses a cotton sack passed through three generations to reconstruct the lives of enslaved women erased from official records.

9781455502776,Arguably,Essays by Christopher Hitchens,"Few contemporary writers possessed Christopher Hitchens's capacity for intellectual combat, wielding prose as both scalpel and sword in defense of rational thought. This collection showcases an essayist who refused to retreat from controversial positions, instead advancing arguments with surgical precision and devastating wit.

The volume spans literary criticism and political commentary, offering fresh insights into towering figures like Charles Dickens, George Orwell, and Karl Marx alongside sharp observations from decades of international journalism across Iran, China, and Pakistan. Hitchens demonstrates an remarkable ability to connect disparate ideas—finding unexpected links between literature and politics, between historical figures and contemporary concerns.

What distinguishes this work is Hitchens's unwavering commitment to following evidence rather than ideology, even when conclusions prove uncomfortable. His essays reveal a mind constantly questioning received wisdom, challenging orthodoxies across the political spectrum. The result is an intellectual autobiography told through criticism, showcasing a writer whose devotion to clarity of thought matched his mastery of language—a testament to the power of reasoned discourse in an increasingly polarized world.","Hitchens at his most essential: four decades of pitch-perfect prose defending the principles of reason, tolerance, and skepticism that define civilization.

""Anyone who occasionally opens one of our more serious periodicals has learned that the byline of Christopher Hitchens is an opportunity to be delighted or maddened-possibly both-but in any case not to be missed....His range is extraordinary, both in breadth and altitude. He is as self-confident on the politics of Lebanon as on the ontology of the Harry Potter books....I still find Hitchens one of the most stimulating thinkers and entertaining we have, even when-perhaps especially when-he provokes.""

—Bill Keller, The New York Times

""One reads him [Hitchens] despite his reputation as someone who wants to drink, argue, and tear the ornaments off the tree, because he is, first and last, a writer, an always exciting, often exacting, furious polemicist. This fact, the most salient thing about him, often gets neglected in the public jousting. Arguably, Hitchens's new collection, forcefully proves this point. Consisting of three kinds of writing - literary journalism, political commentary, and cultural complaint - Arguably offers a panoramic if somewhat jaundiced view of the last decade or so of cultural and political history.""

9780316176484,Life After Life,,"What if death wasn't final? In 1910 England, Ursula Todd experiences something extraordinary: every time her life ends, it begins anew. Born into the same family on the same winter night, she lives countless variations of existence, each shaped by different choices and circumstances.

As the twentieth century unfolds around her, Ursula navigates childhood, adolescence, and adulthood across multiple timelines. Sometimes she dies young, other times she lives to see the horrors of two world wars. With each rebirth comes new knowledge, new possibilities, and new questions about destiny and free will.

The novel examines whether we can truly change the trajectory of history through individual action. As Ursula becomes increasingly aware of her unique situation, she faces an impossible question: if she possesses the ability to prevent catastrophe, what is her responsibility to act? Atkinson weaves together themes of family, trauma, and resilience while challenging conventional narrative structure, creating a meditation on the infinite possibilities contained within a single human life.","Ursula Todd dies at birth, then lives again—and again—through multiple lifetimes spanning two world wars.

What impresses me about this flip book of nonstop scenarios - in wartime and peacetime - is not only how absorbing they are, but how brave Atkinson is to have written them. After all, there really isn't much recent precedent for a major, serious yet playfully experimental novel with a female character at its center.

9780385350662,The Invention of Nature,Alexander von Humboldt's New World,"Few scientists have lived as adventurously as Alexander von Humboldt, the 19th-century German naturalist who scaled active volcanoes and traversed disease-ridden territories in pursuit of knowledge. Yet his physical courage paled beside his intellectual daring: Humboldt proposed that nature operated as a unified web of relationships, challenging the era's view of the natural world as humanity's dominion.

Andrea Wulf resurrects this forgotten giant of science, tracing how his global expeditions revealed unexpected connections between distant ecosystems and climates. Humboldt's insights about environmental interdependence proved prophetic—he foresaw how human activity might alter Earth's climate centuries before such concerns became mainstream.

The naturalist's influence rippled through literature and science, igniting imaginations from Charles Darwin to Henry David Thoreau. His holistic vision of nature helped birth the conservation movement and shaped how we understand ecological systems today. Wulf demonstrates that Humboldt's integration of scientific rigor with poetic sensibility created a new way of seeing our planet—one that remains startlingly relevant as we grapple with environmental crisis.","The forgotten story of Alexander von Humboldt, the visionary German naturalist whose revolutionary ideas about interconnected nature created modern environmentalism and inspired Darwin, Thoreau, and countless others.",496,,Nature / Environmental Conservation & Protection,Knopf,15/09/2015,Andrea Wulf,"Born in India and raised in Germany, Andrea Wulf has established herself as a distinctive voice in narrative nonfiction.

I always trust her to take me on unforgettable journeys through amazing histories of botanical exploration and scientific unfolding.

""Wulf (Chasing Venus) makes an impassioned case for the reinstatement of the boundlessly energetic, perpetually curious, prolific polymath von Humboldt (1769–1859) as a key figure in the history of science. . . . Wulf's stories of wilderness adventure and academic exchange flow easily, and her affection for von Humboldt is contagious.""

9780735212176,Exit West,,"Love blooms between Nadia and Saeed amid the chaos of their disintegrating homeland. As their city transforms into a battleground of military checkpoints and sudden explosions, their relationship deepens in defiance of the surrounding devastation.

Rumors circulate about mysterious doorways—portals offering escape to distant lands, though at great risk. Faced with escalating danger, the couple makes the desperate choice to abandon everything they've known and step through one of these enigmatic passages.

Their journey becomes an exploration of identity, belonging, and human resilience as they navigate unfamiliar territories far from home. Hamid crafts a narrative that examines how displacement reshapes not only where we live, but who we become. The novel interrogates whether love can survive the profound changes that come with losing one's place in the world.

Through this intimate portrait of two people caught in extraordinary circumstances, the story illuminates universal questions about migration, adaptation, and the courage required to rebuild a life from nothing. It's a meditation on how we maintain our humanity when everything familiar disappears.",Two young lovers flee their war-torn homeland through magical doors that transport refugees across the globe.

He splits his time among three cities: Lahore, New York, and London.","""In spare, crystalline prose, Hamid conveys the experience of living in a city under siege with sharp, stabbing immediacy. He shows just how swiftly ordinary life — with all its banal rituals and routines — can morph into the defensive crouch of life in a war zone. … [and] how insidiously violence alters the calculus of daily life. … By mixing the real and the surreal, and using old fairy-tale magic, Hamid has created a fictional universe that captures the global perils percolating beneath today's headlines.""

—Michiko Kakutani, New York Times

""No novel is really about the cliche called 'the human condition,' but good novels expose and interpret the particular condition of the humans in their charge, and this is what Hamid has achieved here. If in its physical and perilous immediacy Nadia and Saeed's condition is alien to the mass of us, Exit West makes a final, certain declaration of affinity: 'We are all migrants through time.'""

9780374202392,A Manual for Cleaning Women,Selected Stories,"Lucia Berlin transforms life's harsh realities into art through stories that pulse with authenticity and dark humor. Her characters—cleaning women, telephone operators, mothers stretched thin—inhabit a world where survival requires both resilience and unexpected tenderness.

Berlin draws readers into truck stops and treatment centers, wealthy households where her protagonists scrub floors, and the dusty corners of the Southwest where hope flickers against long odds. Her voice carries the weight of lived experience, shaped by addiction, failed relationships, and the relentless work of raising children while chasing dreams.

These tales reveal how ordinary moments can crack open to expose profound truths about human connection and endurance. Berlin's characters stumble and recover, finding small salvations in unlikely places—a conversation between strangers, the rhythm of manual labor, the stubborn persistence of love despite everything.

The collection showcases an author who understood that literature's power lies not in grand gestures but in the precise observation of how people navigate disappointment, create meaning from chaos, and discover that even broken lives can yield moments of startling beauty.","Hard-living women navigate Laundromats, halfway houses, and the margins of American life in these unforgettable stories.

Berlin survived three marriages that ended in divorce, battled alcoholism for years, and supported four sons while pursuing her craft. After achieving sobriety in the 1990s, she became a visiting writer at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she was later promoted to associate professor. Berlin died in Marina del Rey in 2004, leaving behind a body of work that captures the American experience from its margins.","""In A Manual for Cleaning Women we witness the emergence of an important American writer, one who was mostly overlooked in her time.

""A posthumous collection of stories, almost uniformly narrated by hard-living women, that makes a case for the author as a major talent . . . The prevailing sensibility of this book, collecting 43 of the 76 stories Berlin published, is cleareyed and even comic in the face of life hitting the skids. The title story, for instance, balances wry commentary about housecleaning work ('never make friends with cats') and deadpan observation ('I clean their coke mirror with Windex') with a sad, thrumming back story.""

9780385545686,Empire of Pain,The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty,"Behind the gleaming marble facades of world-renowned museums lies one of modern America's most disturbing stories of wealth and deception. The Sackler name commands reverence at Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum, and the Louvre, yet the billions funding this cultural largesse originated from a pharmaceutical empire built on addiction and suffering.

This meticulously researched investigation exposes how three generations transformed from ambitious Brooklyn immigrants into titans of influence, wielding their fortune to shape medical practice, regulatory policy, and public perception. From Valium's early success to OxyContin's catastrophic impact, Keefe reveals the calculated strategies used to market dangerous drugs while obscuring their devastating consequences.

The narrative unveils a web of corporate manipulation, regulatory capture, and legal warfare designed to protect profits at any cost. As lawsuits mounted and evidence accumulated, the family deployed armies of lawyers and PR specialists to deflect responsibility for the addiction crisis ravaging communities nationwide. This extraordinary work of investigative journalism illuminates how extreme wealth can insulate perpetrators from accountability, offering a chilling examination of power, privilege, and the human cost of unchecked corporate greed in contemporary America.",Three generations of the Sackler family built a fortune on Valium and OxyContin while their name graced museum walls worldwide.

Each death carries the weight of circumstances beyond individual choice—the legacy of systemic racism, economic deprivation, and limited opportunities that shape life in the rural South.

Ward examines how place and race intersect to create a landscape where young Black men face impossible odds. She traces the connections between historical injustice and present-day tragedy, revealing how poverty becomes a trap that spans generations. Her perspective as someone who left this world through education, then returned to witness its ongoing devastation, allows her to illuminate both the love that binds these communities and the forces that tear them apart.

Isabel Wilkerson dissects this invisible framework by examining how rigid social stratification functions across different societies and time periods. Her analysis draws connections between three distinct contexts—the American experience, India's traditional structure, and the systematic persecution in Nazi Germany—to illuminate universal patterns of human ranking.

Through personal narratives featuring historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and baseball legend Satchel Paige, alongside contemporary stories and her own experiences, Wilkerson demonstrates how this buried system infiltrates daily interactions and life outcomes. Her investigation reveals the mechanisms that have quietly organized American society for generations, showing how an unacknowledged ladder of human worth continues to influence behavior, opportunities, and national direction.

A chance encounter between a troubled teenager and a man facing his mortality transforms both their lives at a frozen lake. A veteran struggles to readjust to civilian life, finding humor and pain in equal measure. A suburban afternoon turns dangerous when violence intrudes on a family's peaceful world.

Saunders excels at illuminating the contradictions of contemporary American life, where comedy and tragedy exist side by side. His characters—outsiders, dreamers, survivors—face impossible choices that reveal their essential goodness despite circumstances that might suggest otherwise. Each story operates as both intimate character study and broader social commentary, examining how people maintain hope and dignity when life tests their limits.

The collection demonstrates Saunders' remarkable range, moving seamlessly between laugh-out-loud moments and scenes of genuine pathos. Rather than offering easy answers, these stories ask difficult questions about compassion, redemption, and what it means to be human in an often inhuman world.","Saunders crafts stories that are simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking, finding profound humanity in unlikely encounters.

9780399588808,Secondhand Time,The Last of the Soviets,"Russia's transformation from Soviet state to capitalist society unfolds through intimate conversations with citizens who lived through decades of upheaval. Alexievich spent twenty years collecting testimonies from people across the former USSR, creating a mosaic of personal experiences that reveals how political collapse reshapes individual lives.

These are not the voices of politicians or historians, but of teachers, factory workers, pensioners, and young adults—people whose memories span Stalin's purges, Soviet pride, and the confusion of sudden freedom.

9780385547772,Stay True,A Memoir,"Two college students couldn't be more different in their approach to American identity. One embraces mainstream culture wholeheartedly, while the other cultivates his outsider status through underground music and alternative scenes. Their unlikely bond develops through shared late-night conversations and the ordinary rhythms of university life, bridging what initially seemed like an unbridgeable cultural divide.

Their friendship becomes a lens for examining what it means to belong in America when you don't fit neatly into prescribed categories. Both young men navigate the complex terrain of Asian American identity, each choosing different strategies for finding their place in a culture that often renders them invisible.

Tragedy strikes without warning, cutting short a relationship that had begun to redefine both of their understandings of authenticity and connection. In the aftermath of devastating loss, writing becomes a way to preserve not just memory, but the profound questions their friendship raised about identity, culture, and the unexpected ways people can matter to each other. This memoir transforms personal grief into a broader meditation on how we construct meaning from the fragments of our experience.","Hua Hsu excavates the friendship that defined his college years—and the violent loss that ended it.

""At once a coming-of-age memoir, a devastating elegy for a departed friend, and a mixtape of all the music and other shards of culture and experience that coalesce into an identity, Stay True is wildly original.

""Stay True feels like one of those books that is the sum total of a writer's life in thinking, craft, and curiosity, made felt at last, so that when the sentences come, they come with a deliberate, patient, and precise force. Hsu takes on the central theme of a friend's violent loss and casts from that void a story that, somehow, despite the hurt and confusion, embraces the world around it with a steady and capacious centrifugal force. This is the endeavor of writing at its most open, meticulous, forgiving and tender—which is to say, this is writing at its best.""

Journalist Elizabeth Kolbert embarks on a global investigation, traveling alongside researchers who are documenting this unprecedented biological crisis in real time. From coral reefs in the Pacific to mountain slopes in South America, she reveals how human activity is reshaping the natural world at an alarming pace.

Through encounters with species both vanished and vanishing—the Panamanian golden frog, the great auk, Sumatran rhinos—Kolbert weaves together stories of loss that illuminate our planet's fragile biodiversity.

Her urban upbringing with educated, ambitious parents stands in stark contrast to her summers in rural Georgia, where family secrets run as deep as the red clay soil. There, her great-grandmother's ghost seems to whisper from every corner of the ancestral home, while her color-conscious grandmother enforces rules that feel like relics from another era.

The young woman's search for identity becomes a reckoning with American history itself. As Ailey digs into her family's roots, she discovers a tapestry woven from threads of triumph and trauma—stories of enslaved ancestors, Indigenous heritage, and white lineage that complicate easy narratives about race and belonging. Each revelation forces her to confront uncomfortable truths about how the past continues to shape the present.

This biography cuts through millennia of distortion to reveal a ruler whose political acumen and diplomatic brilliance far exceeded her legendary beauty.

Cleopatra's reign was marked by calculated violence and strategic alliances that would determine the fate of empires. She eliminated rivals within her own family while forging crucial partnerships with Rome's most powerful leaders. Her connections to Julius Caesar and Mark Antony were not mere romantic entanglements but sophisticated political maneuvers that secured Egypt's position on the world stage.

Drawing from ancient sources long overshadowed by theatrical interpretations and Hollywood spectacle, Schiff reconstructs the true story of a monarch who spoke nine languages, commanded naval fleets, and negotiated with the cunning of a master diplomat.

This experimental work defies conventional boundaries, blending intimate family history with broader cultural examination to illuminate the complexities of Black experience across time.

Central to this tapestry is Sharpe's relationship with her mother, Ida Wright Sharpe, whose influence permeates every page—teaching the author both how to observe and how to look away, instilling a deep appreciation for language and aesthetics. Through this maternal lens, Sharpe develops what she calls an aesthetic of beauty as methodology, creating space for voices and stories that might otherwise remain unheard.

This groundbreaking biography illuminates how Baldwin's relationships with painter Beauford Delaney, Swiss lover Lucien Happersberger, Turkish actor Engin Cezzar, and French artist Yoran Cazac provided the raw material for his transformative literature.

Through meticulous archival research, Nicholas Boggs reveals the intricate ways Baldwin channeled the tensions and passions of these bonds—spanning continents, cultures, and artistic mediums—into the essays, novels, and plays that would challenge America's conscience.

This contemporary retelling of Dickens' classic follows a young narrator as he confronts institutional neglect while clinging to the mountain landscape that both nurtures and traps him. Athletic dreams collide with harsh realities, love brings both salvation and devastation, and survival becomes an art form practiced daily.

Kingsolver channels Dickens' social conscience into a distinctly American tragedy, illuminating how poverty perpetuates itself across generations.

Confined in their floating prison, hunger and desperation strip away all pretense, revealing the raw truths of their relationship. Each day tests not only their will to live but their capacity to coexist when escape is impossible.

This gripping account examines how crisis can simultaneously destroy and strengthen human bonds. Elmhirst crafts a narrative that oscillates between heart-stopping maritime drama and intimate psychological study, questioning whether love can survive when two people have nowhere left to hide from each other or themselves.","When a breaching whale destroys their boat in the Pacific, Maurice and Maralyn face months adrift in a rubber raft.

9781501134616,Midnight in Chernobyl,The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster,"In the predawn darkness of April 1986, a catastrophic explosion at a Soviet nuclear facility forever altered our understanding of atomic energy and government accountability. What followed was decades of deliberate obfuscation, official denials, and carefully crafted narratives designed to obscure the truth.

Adam Higginbotham strips away these layers of deception through exhaustive research and firsthand testimonies from survivors, engineers, and officials who lived through those harrowing days. His investigation reveals not just the technical failures that led to catastrophe, but the human decisions, institutional pressures, and systemic flaws that made disaster inevitable.

This account transcends typical disaster narratives by examining how ordinary people responded to extraordinary circumstances—from plant workers racing against time to contain the damage, to residents forced to abandon their homes forever. Higginbotham illuminates the intersection of scientific hubris, political corruption, and individual courage in ways that resonate far beyond nuclear policy.

The result is both historical reckoning and cautionary tale, demonstrating how the pursuit of technological progress without adequate safeguards can unleash consequences that span generations and continents.",Ten years of investigation yields the definitive account of Chernobyl. Higginbotham cuts through decades of propaganda to reveal the human story behind history's worst nuclear disaster.,560,,History / Russia,Simon & Schuster,12/02/2019,Adam Higginbotham,"Adam Higginbotham contributes to major publications including The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Wired, GQ, and Smithsonian.

Armed with little more than his treasured copy of The Jungle Book and fragments of the stories he once shared, she begins to uncover secrets that stretch far beyond her family's history.

At the heart of her investigation lies a figure known as ""the deathless man""—someone who appears throughout her grandfather's past at pivotal moments. Yet it's another story, one he never shared, that proves most revealing: the tale of a tiger's wife, a legend that bridges the gap between village superstition and lived experience.

Obreht constructs a narrative where ancient beliefs collide with modern realities, showing how communities devastated by conflict find meaning through the stories they tell. Natalia's search becomes something larger—an exploration of how folklore preserves truth that facts alone cannot capture. The novel examines the ways people process trauma and loss, revealing how mythic thinking helps us navigate experiences too complex for rational explanation alone.","In war-torn Balkans, a young doctor unravels her grandfather's mysterious death through his tales of a mythical tiger and an immortal stranger.

A family crisis forces his return to Nazi-controlled Austria, where Joseph Goebbels recognizes opportunity. The propaganda minister dangles artistic freedom and protection, but his offers carry the weight of command. Pabst convinces himself he can navigate this dangerous game, using his position to serve art rather than ideology.

The distance between artistic integrity and survival narrows with each compromise. Daniel Kehlmann crafts a psychological portrait of creative ambition colliding with authoritarian power, examining how easily principles bend under pressure. Through Pabst's ordeal, the novel interrogates whether art can remain pure when created under corrupt systems, and what price artists pay when they believe their talent exempts them from moral accountability.","When legendary director G.W.

Yet beneath this picture of suburban success lay a medical mystery that would captivate researchers for decades.

Six of the Galvin sons developed schizophrenia, an unprecedented concentration of the disorder within a single family. Their experiences became a crucial case study for the National Institute of Mental Health, contributing genetic material and data that shaped our understanding of mental illness. Robert Kolker traces both the family's private struggles and the broader scientific quest to comprehend schizophrenia, from primitive early treatments to modern genetic research.

The narrative reveals how one family's tragedy became intertwined with the evolution of psychiatric medicine, while never losing sight of the human cost. Kolker examines the complex dynamics within a household where mental illness created cycles of trauma, the challenges faced by unaffected siblings, and the parents' attempts to maintain normalcy. This is both an intimate family portrait and a window into how science grapples with one of its most elusive challenges.","The devastating story of a midcentury American family with twelve children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became central to our scientific understanding of the disease.",400,,Biography & Autobiography / Medical (incl.

Over twelve months, we meet the women whose lives intersect with this tragedy—from those who witnessed the crime to mothers grappling with their own fears.

Phillips constructs a mosaic of voices that reveals how violence ripples outward, exposing the ethnic divisions and social hierarchies that define this isolated region. The peninsula itself becomes a character—its volcanic landscape and proximity to both Japan and Alaska creating a sense of beautiful isolation that both protects and imprisons its inhabitants.

What emerges is less a traditional mystery than an intimate portrait of how communities respond to loss. Each woman's story illuminates different aspects of Russian life in this forgotten corner of the world, where indigenous peoples navigate alongside Russian settlers, and where the search for the missing children becomes a lens for examining larger questions about belonging, suspicion, and survival. The result is a debut that uses crime as a starting point for a deeper exploration of place, identity, and the bonds that hold societies together.","Two sisters disappear from a remote Russian peninsula, sending ripples through their community over the course of a year.

What begins as a missing person case evolves into something far more sinister, exposing the dark undercurrents of Japan's hostess bar culture and the predators who exploit it.

Journalist Richard Lloyd Parry spent years unraveling this mystery, following leads from Tokyo's neon-lit streets to courtrooms where unspeakable crimes came to light. His investigation reveals not just the fate of one woman, but a pattern of violence that had remained hidden for years. Through meticulous reporting and unprecedented access to investigators, families, and the accused, Parry constructs a narrative that transcends typical crime reporting.

James Cook earned fame for his remarkable voyages across the Pacific, mapping unknown territories while maintaining unusual respect for indigenous cultures he encountered. His reputation for fair treatment of both crew and native peoples set him apart from his contemporaries.

But Cook's third expedition reveals a different man entirely. The disciplined explorer who once approached new societies with scientific curiosity began employing savage punishments and authorizing vicious reprisals against island communities. His decision-making grew erratic, his leadership harsh and unpredictable.

What drove this dramatic shift remains one of history's most intriguing puzzles. Secret imperial directives to claim territories ahead of European competitors may have corrupted his scientific mission. The pressure to locate the elusive Northwest Passage perhaps pushed him beyond his limits. Regardless of the cause, Cook's final journey exposes how exploration and conquest intertwined, with devastating consequences for Pacific peoples.

Aomame discovers that her familiar city has subtly transformed into something alien—a place she dubs 1Q84, where small but unsettling details signal she's crossed into an alternate dimension. Across the city, Tengo accepts what seems like a straightforward editing job, only to find himself drawn deeper into a web involving a enigmatic teenage author and her haunting manuscript.

As both characters navigate their shifting realities, their paths interweave with a cast of unforgettable figures: a reclusive woman who shelters abuse victims, a grotesque private detective, and members of a shadowy religious movement. The novel builds toward revelations about childhood bonds, the nature of parallel worlds, and the mysterious forces that guide human connection across time and space.

Murakami constructs a labyrinthine narrative that balances philosophical inquiry with page-turning suspense, creating a reading experience that feels both dreamlike and urgently real. The result is a meditation on love, memory, and the thin boundaries between the world we know and the worlds that might exist just beyond our perception.","In 1984 Tokyo, a woman discovers she's slipped into a parallel world while a writer becomes entangled with a mysterious cult.

Murakami's fans know that his focus has always been on the quiet strangeness of life, the hidden connections between perfect strangers, and the power of the non sequitur to reveal the associative strands that weave our modern world. 1Q84 goes further than any Murakami novel so far, and perhaps further than any novel before it, toward exposing the delicacy of the membranes that separate love from chance encounters, the kind from the wicked, and reality from what people living in the pent-up modern world dream about when they go to sleep under an alien moon.""

Instead, Andrew Solomon argues that the experience of being different forms a common thread binding all humanity together.

The book centers on an essential tension every parent faces—balancing acceptance of who their child is against the desire to help them flourish. Solomon examines this delicate dynamic through the lens of families raising children with conditions ranging from deafness and autism to those who are prodigies or transgender.

What emerges from hundreds of intimate conversations is a portrait of resilience that defies easy categorization. These families navigate territory where societal expectations collide with unconditional love, where difference becomes both challenge and gift. Solomon reveals how parents and children forge bonds that transcend conventional understanding, creating their own definitions of normal.

The result is an investigation into identity itself—how we define ourselves, how we relate to those closest to us, and how love adapts to circumstances that test its very foundations.

A mortuary affairs specialist processes the remains of friend and enemy alike. A chaplain watches his faith crumble under the weight of military brutality. Another Marine carries guilt for a death that wasn't his fault, desperate to ease his friend's burden. The collection moves between combat zones where survival depends on split-second decisions and suburban homes where the same veterans struggle to connect with a world that seems impossibly distant from their experience.

Klay captures the strange mixture of boredom and terror that defines military service, where teaching baseball to Iraqis becomes a surreal diplomatic mission and routine patrols can explode into life-or-death encounters.

As she did so masterfully with Half of a Yellow Sun, Adichie paints on a grand canvas, boldly and confidently, equally adept at conveying the complicated political backdrop of Lagos as she is in bringing us into the day-to-day lives of her many new Americans—a single mom, a student, a hairdresser. This is a very funny, very warm and moving intergenerational epic that confirms Adichie's virtuosity, boundless empathy and searing social acuity.""

9780670022205,Malcolm X,A Life of Reinvention,"Malcolm X died at thirty-nine, but in his brief life he embodied multiple identities that would define African American resistance for generations. Manning Marable's exhaustive research reveals a figure far more nuanced than the mythology suggests—a man whose personal transformations mirrored the broader evolution of black political consciousness in America.

This biography excavates the forces that shaped Malcolm's worldview, from his family's early encounters with both Garveyism and white supremacist violence to his complex relationship with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Marable traces how Malcolm's intellectual development paralleled the shifting landscape of civil rights activism, showing how his break from the NOI positioned him at the center of emerging black nationalist thought.

Drawing on previously unavailable sources, Marable reconstructs the final months of Malcolm's life with forensic precision, offering new insights into the circumstances surrounding his murder. The result is a portrait of someone who understood that personal reinvention and political liberation were inseparable—a man whose influence on subsequent movements for racial justice cannot be overstated.","Marable's landmark biography draws on new sources and revelatory research to present the fullest, most complex portrait yet of Malcolm X—stripping away decades of myth to reveal the man behind the icon.",608,,Biography & Autobiography / Social Activists,Viking Press,04/04/2011,Manning Marable,"Manning Marable (1950–2011) held appointments as Professor of African-American Studies and of Public Affairs, History and Political Science at Columbia University. His published works include Black American Politics, Black Leadership, Living Black History, Beyond Black and White: From Civil Rights to Barack Obama, and Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.","""It will be difficult for anyone to better this book. It goes deeper and richer than a mere homage to Malcolm X. It is a work of art, a feast that combines genres skillfully: biography, true-crime, political commentary. It gives us Malcolm X in full gallop, a man who died for his belief in freedom, a man whom Marable calls the 'fountainhead' of the black power movement in America.""

—The Washington Post

""In his revealing and prodigiously researched new biography, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention, Manning Marable - a professor at Columbia University and the director of its Center for Contemporary Black History, who died just last week - vividly chronicles these many incarnations of his subject. . . Mr. Marable artfully strips away the layers and layers of myth that have been lacquered onto his subject's life - first by Malcolm himself in that famous memoir, and later by both supporters and opponents after his assassination in 1965 at the age of 39.""

—Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times

""Unlike Bruce Perry's 1991 biography, Malcolm, which entertained the most outlandish stories in an attempt to present a comprehensive portrait, Marable's biography judiciously sifts fact from myth.""

9780385535595,Dark Money,The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right,"Behind America's political transformation lies a carefully orchestrated campaign by billionaire ideologues who built an empire of influence from the shadows. Jane Mayer's investigation reveals the sophisticated machinery these ultra-rich libertarians constructed—a vast network spanning universities, courts, and grassroots organizations—all designed to advance their economic interests while appearing as genuine political movements.

The book chronicles how fringe economic theories became accepted policy through strategic funding and patient institution-building. Mayer documents the methodical approach these donors used to capture academic departments, bankroll legal challenges, and create the intellectual framework that would later justify deregulation and tax cuts benefiting the wealthy.

What emerges is a portrait of American democracy under siege by concentrated wealth. The investigation demonstrates how a handful of families leveraged their fortunes to rewrite the rules of capitalism in their favor, often at the expense of environmental protection and economic equality. This meticulous work of journalism illuminates the hidden architecture of modern American politics.","Five years of investigative reporting reveals how billionaire libertarians secretly funded a political revolution.

But death has a way of exposing the fragile foundations beneath even the most established traditions. After losing the family matriarch, each surviving member responds to grief in their own desperate way—one sibling chases phantoms through the marshland, another abandons everything to join the corporate enemy, and their father simply vanishes into the wilderness.

Thirteen-year-old Ava finds herself the unlikely guardian of both her family's crumbling dream and nearly a hundred dangerous reptiles. Her journey through the labyrinthine swamps becomes something far more treacherous than a simple rescue mission. Russell constructs a landscape where folklore breathes alongside harsh reality, where coming-of-age collides with economic ruin, and where the boundary between what's real and what we need to believe becomes as fluid as the wetlands themselves. This is a story about the stories we tell ourselves to survive loss, and what happens when even those stories begin to fail us.",Thirteen-year-old Ava struggles to save her family's failing alligator theme park after her mother's death tears the Bigtrees apart.

Fresh from combat in Iraq, he and his squad have become reluctant celebrities after their firefight was captured on camera, turning them into poster boys for a conflict most Americans experience only through television screens.

The contrast couldn't be starker: while wealthy fans and corporate sponsors treat the soldiers like exotic trophies, Billy grapples with memories of his fallen sergeant and the knowledge that he'll soon return to the battlefield. The glittering halftime spectacle becomes a funhouse mirror reflecting America's complicated relationship with its wars—where genuine sacrifice meets manufactured patriotism, and where young men are celebrated as heroes while remaining fundamentally misunderstood.

Billy's internal struggle intensifies as he faces an impossible choice between duty and desire, between his brothers-in-arms and a chance at love. The novel dissects the machinery of modern warfare and celebrity culture with surgical precision, revealing how easily heroism becomes commodity and how the true cost of conflict remains hidden beneath layers of pageantry and political theater.","Iraq War soldiers become unlikely celebrities at a Dallas Cowboys game, exposing the chasm between battlefield reality and American spectacle.

Both gain admission to Yale, where one rockets through his studies with extraordinary success while the other begins to notice troubling changes beneath his friend's achievements.

A devastating phone call shatters everything: Michael Laudor has experienced a complete psychological collapse, landing him in psychiatric care with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Against all odds, he fights his way back, enrolling at Yale Law School while still wrestling with delusions. The media celebrates his remarkable comeback story, Hollywood buys his memoir, and he becomes a symbol of triumph over mental illness.

But the victory proves illusory. Trapped within an unbreakable paranoid delusion, Michael commits an act of violence that destroys lives and transforms him from inspiration to cautionary tale. Jonathan Rosen examines this devastating trajectory with unflinching honesty, weaving together personal memory, cultural analysis, and hard questions about how society understands and treats mental illness. The result is both an intimate portrait of friendship's limits and a broader meditation on the distance between our best intentions and their real-world consequences.","Two childhood friends seemed destined for greatness until one was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

Henry Skrimshander's professional dreams hang in the balance as he battles the mental demons that followed his crucial error. Around him, four other lives spiral into unexpected territory: a college president discovers late-in-life passion, a student-athlete navigates a risky romantic entanglement, a team captain confronts the sacrifices he's made for others, and a young woman seeks to rebuild after her marriage falls apart.

The baseball diamond becomes a stage where personal reckonings play out against the rhythm of a season building toward its finale. Each character must wrestle with questions of identity, desire, and the price of pursuing what matters most.

The narrative begins with a working-class child who dreams of literary fame despite her family's skepticism. As she matures, questions of sexuality and independence emerge alongside her first attempts at professional writing.

The final volume reveals how marriage to a physician becomes a gateway to prescription drug dependency, transforming her life into a cycle of manipulation and self-destruction. Ditlevsen examines the competing demands of creativity and conventional womanhood—how society's expectations for wives and mothers can suffocate artistic ambition.

Her stark honesty about addiction, relationships, and the writing life creates an intimate portrait of a woman caught between worlds. The work captures the particular challenges faced by female artists in mid-century Denmark, where literary circles remained largely masculine domains. Through precise, unadorned language, these memoirs reveal both the cost of pursuing art and the price of abandoning oneself to dependency.","Ditlevsen chronicles her journey from working-class girlhood to literary ambition to devastating addiction.

But participation in an anti-Qaddafi demonstration in London shatters his plans—violence erupts, leaving him wounded and stranded between countries. He cannot return to Libya, nor can he safely communicate his circumstances to his family, knowing their phone conversations are monitored by the regime.

Her father defies every stereotype of Catholic clergy—he's a guitar-wielding, movie-loving figure whose unconventional approach to priesthood shaped Lockwood's complicated relationship with faith.

This memoir braids together memories from her youth with the surreal experience of being an adult living in her parents' rectory. Lockwood navigates the absurdities of this arrangement while reflecting on formative experiences that range from deeply personal to darkly comic. The narrative examines how we reconcile the people we've become with the families and institutions that formed us.

Lockwood's sharp wit illuminates the contradictions inherent in growing up within rigid religious structures while witnessing their human imperfections up close.

Rescued by an affluent family whose world feels alien to his own, Theo struggles to rebuild his identity while carrying the weight of his secret. The stolen artwork connects him to a hidden network of dealers and collectors, drawing him deeper into a realm where beauty and corruption intertwine.

Siddhartha Mukherjee tackles this fundamental question by tracing humanity's centuries-long effort to decode heredity's mysteries. From ancient philosophers pondering inheritance to modern scientists mapping entire genomes, this narrative captures our relentless drive to understand what makes us who we are.

The author transforms complex scientific concepts into accessible storytelling, drawing connections between groundbreaking research and intimate human experiences. His own family's struggles with mental illness serve as a lens through which larger questions emerge: How do our genes influence behavior, disease, and destiny? What ethical boundaries should guide our newfound ability to edit the genetic code itself?

This exploration reveals both the extraordinary promise and unsettling implications of genetic knowledge. As we gain unprecedented power to alter life at its most fundamental level, Mukherjee examines what it means to wield such capability responsibly. The result is a thought-provoking examination of science, identity, and the future of human evolution.","From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author comes a sweeping exploration of genetics that weaves together scientific discovery, family memoir, and the ethical questions surrounding our genetic future.",608,,Medical / History,Scribner,17/05/2016,Siddhartha Mukherjee,"Siddhartha Mukherjee has written The Song of the Cell, The Gene: An Intimate History (#1 New York Times bestseller), The Emperor of All Maladies (2011 Pulitzer Prize winner), and The Laws of Medicine.

9781555977078,The Argonauts,A Memoir,"In this boundary-dissolving work of autotheory, a writer chronicles her experience of pregnancy while building a life with her fluidly gendered partner, artist Harry Dodge. The narrative moves fluidly between intimate domestic moments and philosophical inquiry, examining how academic theory intersects with lived experience.

Nelson interrogates fundamental questions about identity, sexuality, and what constitutes family in contemporary America. Her approach mirrors the intellectual tradition of thinkers like Susan Sontag, weaving together personal revelation with scholarly analysis. The book refuses easy categorization, functioning simultaneously as love story, philosophical treatise, and meditation on language itself.

What emerges is a fierce argument for both radical autonomy and the profound importance of care—seemingly contradictory impulses that Nelson demonstrates can coexist. Her unflinching examination of queer parenthood and partnership offers no simple answers, instead embracing the messy complexities of human connection. The result is a work that challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about desire, commitment, and the stories we tell about our most intimate relationships.","Nelson weaves personal narrative with critical theory to explore queer love, family-making, and identity.

Within this fractured society, Frances Wray lives quietly with her mother in their Camberwell home—a house that once bustled with family life but now stands as a monument to their reduced circumstances.

Financial necessity compels the women to open their doors to paying tenants. The Barbers arrive as representatives of Britain's changing social fabric—young, ambitious, and unbound by the rigid conventions that have long governed the Wray household.

Frances finds herself drawn into unfamiliar territory as these newcomers challenge the boundaries she has carefully maintained. The novel examines how proximity breeds intimacy, and how the collision between different worlds can ignite desires that threaten to consume everything in their path. Waters crafts a story where social transformation becomes deeply personal, exploring the dangerous territory between respectability and rebellion in a society struggling to redefine itself.","When a widowed mother and daughter take in lodgers in 1922 London, their genteel world fractures.

9780547134666,House of Stone,"A Memoir of Home, Family, and a Lost Middle East","After surviving captivity and violence while reporting on the Libyan revolution, journalist Anthony Shadid makes an unexpected choice. Rather than seeking comfort in familiar places, he returns to a crumbling ancestral home in Lebanon—his great-grandfather's abandoned estate that he'd been slowly restoring.

This decision becomes the heart of a deeply personal journey that weaves together stone and memory, trauma and healing. As Shadid works to resurrect rooms and rebuild walls, he excavates his own family's story of displacement and adaptation across generations. The physical act of restoration becomes inseparable from his emotional reckoning with a life spent documenting conflict.

Through the lens of this single house, Shadid creates an intimate portrait of belonging that transcends borders. His narrative moves fluidly between the immediacy of construction work and the broader sweep of Lebanese history, between personal grief and collective memory. The result is both a love letter to a vanishing way of life and a meditation on how we construct identity from the fragments of our past.","War correspondent Anthony Shadid rebuilds his great-grandfather's Lebanese estate while grappling with trauma from covering Middle Eastern conflicts.

Decades pass before fate brings them back into each other's orbits, forcing a reckoning with choices made in desperation and acts committed in the name of survival. Lee constructs a narrative that spans continents and generations, examining how trauma reshapes identity and whether redemption remains possible for those who have lost everything.

This sweeping story interrogates the true cost of heroism and questions what we owe to those we've failed. Through intricately woven timelines, Lee reveals how a single moment of connection can reverberate across a lifetime, creating bonds that neither time nor distance can fully sever.","Three lives intersect at a Korean War orphanage, then collide again thirty years later.

René Sel endures the backbreaking work of forest clearing, eventually marrying into the Mi'kmaw community and creating a family line forever caught between worlds. Charles Duquet breaks free from his obligations through cunning and ambition, launching himself into the fur trade and ultimately establishing a vast logging dynasty.

Across three hundred years, their descendants scatter from the Canadian wilderness to the trading ports of China and the remote forests of New Zealand. Each generation faces its own trials—violence, disease, cultural upheaval, and the relentless pursuit of profit from an apparently endless supply of trees.

Proulx constructs an intricate tapestry that weaves together individual human drama with the larger story of environmental devastation. The novel examines how personal ambition and survival instincts drive broader patterns of exploitation, ultimately questioning whether the natural abundance that once seemed limitless can survive humanity's hunger for resources. Through vivid characterization spanning centuries, she illuminates the complex relationship between human progress and ecological destruction.","Two French indentured servants in 17th-century New France take vastly different paths—one trapped between cultures, the other building a timber empire.

""Magnificent... Barkskins flies... One of the chief pleasures of Proulx's prose is that it conveys you to so many vanished wildwoods, where you get to stand 'tiny and amazed in the kingdom of pines.' This is also the great sadness of Barkskins. The propulsive tension here is generated not by wondering what will happen to each character, but by knowing that the forests will be leveled one after another...

While television cameras captured the surface drama, the underground reality remained hidden from view.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Héctor Tobar gained unprecedented access to the survivors, who had made a pact to tell their story as one voice. Their account reveals how ordinary men faced extraordinary circumstances in a space that became simultaneously tomb and sanctuary. In the suffocating darkness, they grappled with despair and hope, hunger and faith, creating bonds that sustained them through an ordeal that tested the limits of human endurance.

Tobar transforms their collective testimony into immersive storytelling that captures both the physical reality of their underground prison and the psychological journey of men confronting their own mortality. The narrative illuminates how crisis can reveal the deepest aspects of human nature, showing how individuals can find meaning and connection even in the most desperate circumstances.","Thirty-three miners trapped beneath thousands of feet of rock for sixty-nine days finally tell their story.

Golden Richards oversees a chaotic empire of four wives and twenty-eight children, but his world is cracking under the weight of financial ruin and devastating personal losses. The death of his daughter and the stillbirth of his son have left him spiritually adrift, even as his construction business crumbles and his sprawling family descends into feuds and rebellion.

Brady Udall crafts a remarkable portrait of a man whose deep religious convictions clash with human frailty. As Golden becomes involved in a relationship that could destroy his already fragile world, the novel examines how we navigate between duty and desire, faith and doubt. The story unfolds as both intimate character study and sweeping family saga, revealing the absurd and heartbreaking realities of a life lived at impossible scale.

This is American fiction at its most ambitious—a work that finds profound meaning in the collision between traditional values and modern chaos, between the sacred and the profane.","Golden Richards, a polygamist with four wives and 28 children, struggles with desire, secrecy, and the chaos of family life.

9781524732851,Fire Weather,A True Story from a Hotter World,"The catastrophic 2016 wildfire that consumed Fort McMurray offers a startling glimpse into humanity's evolving dance with one of nature's most elemental forces. John Vaillant uses this devastating event—which forced nearly 90,000 residents to flee and caused billions in damage—as a starting point for examining how fire has shaped human civilization and now threatens to reshape it again.

Vaillant traces the deep historical relationship between humans and fire, from our earliest use of flames for cooking and protection to the industrial machinery that powers modern life. But as climate change intensifies, this ancient partnership grows increasingly unstable. The author skillfully connects the dots between Canada's massive oil extraction operations, emerging climate science, and the new reality of megafires that can consume entire cities.

Through vivid storytelling and meticulous research, Vaillant reveals how the same fossil fuel industry centered in Fort McMurray contributes to the very conditions that made such a catastrophic fire possible. He follows the human stories behind the headlines while building a compelling case that we're entering an era where fire will play an increasingly dangerous role in our lives.","The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire becomes a lens for understanding our changing relationship with fire itself.

9780812994827,The Return,"Fathers, Sons and the Land in Between","Three decades after fleeing Libya as a child, Hisham Matar crosses back into his homeland following Qaddafi's fall. The country he finds bears little resemblance to the one his family escaped, yet the questions that drove them into exile remain unanswered. His father, once a diplomat who became an enemy of the state, vanished from Cairo's streets years earlier—another victim swallowed by the regime's machinery of repression.

The empty prison cells offer no revelations, no trace of the man who shaped Matar's understanding of courage and resistance. Instead, this homecoming becomes something more complex: an excavation of memory, identity, and the peculiar mathematics of loss. Matar navigates between his role as son and witness, between the Libya of his childhood imagination and the scarred nation emerging from dictatorship.

This memoir transcends its political backdrop to examine how absence can define a life as powerfully as presence. It reveals the ways tyranny reaches across borders and generations, while also celebrating the stubborn resilience of love and the possibility of return—even when what we seek to recover may be forever beyond reach.",A son returns to post-revolution Libya searching for answers about his father's disappearance under Qaddafi's regime.

""A moving, unflinching memoir of a family torn apart by the savage realities of today's Middle East.

After young Willie Lincoln succumbs to illness in 1862, his spirit enters a liminal space between life and death—a realm populated by restless souls unable to move on.

George Saunders constructs this otherworldly cemetery as a cacophonous theater where the dead debate, argue, and reveal their unfinished business. The narrative unfolds through a chorus of spectral voices, each carrying their own regrets and obsessions. As Lincoln himself wanders the graveyard in his grief, a battle emerges for his son's eternal fate.

This bold reimagining of historical sorrow transcends its Civil War setting to examine universal questions about mortality, attachment, and letting go. Saunders weaves together the intimate anguish of a father's loss with broader meditations on how we cling to what cannot last. The result challenges readers to consider what it means to love fully while accepting life's impermanence, delivered through an innovative structure that feels both playful and profound.","George Saunders transforms the historical death of Lincoln's son into supernatural brilliance.

What followed was one of history's most ambitious social experiments—the systematic dismantling of entire societies and their reconstruction according to Communist ideology.

Anne Applebaum documents this massive undertaking, examining how the Soviet apparatus methodically erased existing institutions, traditions, and ways of life. Through previously inaccessible documents and testimonies from those who lived through this transformation, she illuminates the human cost of ideological revolution. Families watched their communities disappear overnight. Citizens navigated impossible choices between survival and conscience.

The book reveals the machinery behind this continental reshaping—the propaganda campaigns, the surveillance networks, the calculated destruction of civil society. Applebaum shows how quickly familiar worlds can vanish, replaced by systems that turn neighbors into informants and reduce human relationships to political calculations. This is the story of how an entire civilization was erased and rewritten, leaving millions to rebuild their understanding of reality itself.","Applebaum reveals how Stalin systematically converted Eastern Europe to Communism after WWII, transforming millions of lives in the process.

Decades pass, yet the invisible threads connecting these women refuse to break.

Lewis introduces us to the unlikely prophets who dared to bet against conventional wisdom, risking their careers and reputations to short the housing market. Their stories reveal not just prescient analysis, but the psychological fortitude required to maintain conviction while an entire industry called them wrong. Through their eyes, we witness the machinery of financial self-deception and the human cost of institutional blindness.

David and Sarah navigate their first serious relationship amid the intensity of Shakespeare rehearsals and the demanding presence of their charismatic instructor, Mr. Kingsley. Their world revolves around performance and possibility, insulated from ordinary teenage concerns.

Yet reality has a way of breaking through even the most carefully constructed environments. Family obligations, financial pressures, and looming decisions about the future begin to fracture their artistic sanctuary. A series of dramatic events shatters the illusion of their protected space.

Just as readers settle into this coming-of-age narrative, Choi delivers a masterful surprise. The novel reveals that the story we've been following represents only one perspective on these events. New voices emerge to challenge and complicate our understanding, forcing us to question everything we believed about these characters and their experiences.

His romantic words seem to offer guidance as she navigates Dublin's literary scene, searching for her own artistic identity and chasing intense relationships that mirror the passion in his work.

For Nell's mother Carmel, those same poems carry darker memories. She remembers how her father's charm could seduce women into reckless decisions, just as it had her own mother Terry. Yet Phil's gift for beautiful language couldn't compensate for his failures as a parent, leaving Carmel to question how someone capable of such lyrical insight could inflict such lasting damage on those who loved him most.

Through meticulous investigative work, Blitzer traces how political upheaval, endemic violence, and economic collapse have rendered entire communities uninhabitable, forcing people to undertake perilous journeys northward. His reporting illuminates the human cost of bureaucratic dysfunction, revealing how good intentions repeatedly collide with political expediency.

The book captures the experiences of those caught between worlds—migrants who risk everything for safety, officials struggling within broken systems, and communities grappling with the consequences of decades-old choices.

Christopher Clark reconstructs the intricate web of diplomatic failures, miscalculations, and political incompetence that transformed a regional incident in the Balkans into a global war claiming millions of lives.

Through a forensic examination of decision-making in Europe's major capitals, Clark exposes how a continent's leaders—despite their claims to rational governance—repeatedly chose the most destructive path forward. The book illuminates the underlying tensions and systemic weaknesses that made Europe a powder keg waiting to explode, while chronicling the specific moments when diplomacy gave way to military mobilization.

What emerges is a portrait of a political class so trapped by their own assumptions and commitments that they sleepwalked into disaster. Clark's analysis reveals how a supposedly minor crisis in southeastern Europe could unravel decades of relative stability, ultimately reshaping the modern world through unprecedented destruction.","Clark traces Europe's stumble into World War I through thirty-seven fateful days in 1914.

As Good Stab's story unfolds across multiple visits to the pastor's study, a multigenerational saga of vengeance takes shape. The boundaries between the living and the dead blur as historical trauma refuses to remain buried. Jones weaves together elements of the supernatural with unflinching examination of America's violent past, creating a narrative that operates simultaneously as ghost story and historical reckoning.

This is horror rooted in real wounds—a tale where the supernatural emerges not from imagination but from the unresolved grief of genocide.

Kitamura constructs a literary puzzle where dual perspectives illuminate different facets of the same relationship, each voice revealing what the other conceals. The actress, polished and successful, finds herself confronted by someone who may hold keys to understanding herself—or may simply be a stranger with his own agenda.

This psychological study dissects how we inhabit different versions of ourselves depending on who's watching. The novel questions whether we can ever truly know another person, or if we're all perpetually performing roles we've convinced ourselves are authentic. Through precise, measured prose, Kitamura examines the gap between public persona and private truth, exploring how relationships become stages where we audition for acceptance, love, or simply recognition.","Two competing narratives unspool around a lunch between an accomplished actress and a troubling young man.

Her memoir confronts the raw mechanics of surviving catastrophic loss—the rage, the desperate bargaining with fate, the way grief can make even breathing feel like betrayal. Yet gradually, she allows herself to revisit the abundance that preceded tragedy: lazy mornings with her children, academic discussions with her husband, the particular warmth of her parents' presence.

Faludi finds herself navigating uncharted territory as she tries to reconcile this new reality with memories of the volatile, distant figure who shaped her childhood. Her journey leads her deep into her father's past lives—from American suburbia to the peaks of the Alps, from wartime Budapest's Jewish quarter to the shadows of Holocaust survival.

Their reunion in Hungary becomes more than a family reckoning. Faludi discovers a nation wrestling with its own buried truths, where historical amnesia runs deep and political currents threaten to sweep away inconvenient memories.

9780593654477,The MANIAC,,"The brilliant mathematician John von Neumann possessed an intellect so extraordinary it unnerved everyone who encountered it. His revolutionary contributions span game theory, computer science, and artificial intelligence—innovations that continue to reshape civilization in ways we're only beginning to grasp.

Benjamín Labatut constructs a three-part narrative examining the profound consequences of unchecked scientific genius. The story opens with physicist Paul Ehrenfest, Einstein's contemporary, who witnessed science's transformation from pure inquiry into something more menacing. At the center stands von Neumann himself, revealed through the voices of those who knew him—family, collaborators, and competitors who watched his mind operate at superhuman levels.

The final section leaps to our present moment: the historic confrontation between Go champion Lee Sedol and Google's AlphaGo system. This battle between human intuition and machine learning embodies von Neumann's ultimate vision—creating artificial minds capable of surpassing their creators.

Labatut weaves together scientific biography, philosophical meditation, and speculative fiction to examine how individual brilliance can unleash forces beyond our control. The result is a meditation on intelligence itself: what happens when human reason creates something that no longer needs us?","Hungarian polymath John von Neumann invented game theory, built the first programmable computer, and pioneered AI.

9781555976712,The Empathy Exams,Essays,"What begins as an unusual job—acting out medical symptoms for training doctors—becomes the foundation for a remarkable investigation into how we understand and respond to suffering. Leslie Jamison uses this strange professional experience as a launching point to examine the complicated machinery of human compassion.

These essays traverse unexpected terrain: the ethics of disaster tourism, the reality of invisible illnesses, the spectacle of televised emotion, and the intersection of physical pain with social justice. Jamison refuses easy answers about whether our attempts to understand others' experiences bring us closer together or create new forms of judgment and distance.

Rather than offering simple prescriptions for better human connection, she interrogates the very foundations of how we witness pain—both authentic suffering and its more ambiguous cousins. The result is a collection that challenges readers to consider whether true understanding between people is possible, and what it costs us to keep trying. Jamison's inquiry is both philosophical and intensely personal, mapping the difficult space where individual experience meets collective responsibility.","Jamison transforms personal experiences with illness and medical role-playing into profound meditations on empathy, pain, and human connection.

The protagonist navigates the complex social dynamics of teenage life while carrying the weight of his family's expectations and his own reputation as a star debater.

The story takes a dark turn as the social hierarchy shifts and an outsider becomes entangled with the popular crowd, leading to consequences that ripple through multiple generations. The narrative examines how patterns of violence and masculinity pass from fathers to sons, while also exploring a mother's struggle to break free from her own traumatic inheritance.

Lerner constructs a layered examination of American culture at a pivotal moment, revealing the early seeds of the political and social fractures that would later define the 21st century.

9781501125652,Heavy,An American Memoir,"In this deeply personal memoir, Kiese Laymon addresses his mother directly, creating an intimate conversation about the lies families tell and the truths they bury. Growing up in Jackson, Mississippi, Laymon navigates the contradictions of being raised by a brilliant woman whose love comes wrapped in silence and secrets.

The book traces Laymon's evolution from childhood through academia, examining his complicated relationship with food, his body, and the expectations placed on Black men in America. He writes candidly about eating disorders, addiction, and the ways trauma reshapes both memory and flesh. Rather than offering easy redemption, Laymon interrogates the very notion of healing in a society built on systemic harm.

What emerges is both a love letter and an indictment—of family dynamics, educational institutions, and a country that preaches liberation while practicing oppression. Laymon's prose cuts through comfortable narratives about resilience and success, asking instead what it truly means to be free when freedom itself carries such weight. This memoir refuses to separate personal pain from political reality, creating a work that is as much about America as it is about one man's journey toward honest self-examination.","Laymon's unflinching memoir examines the weight of family secrets, personal trauma, and survival as a Black man in America.

It's full of devotion and betrayal, euphoria and anguish, tender embraces and rough abuse…the liberation on offer doesn't feel light and unburdened; it feels heavy like the title, and heavy like the truth…Salvation would feel too weightless—as if [Laymon] could forget who he is and where he has been. This generous, searching book explores all the forces that can stop even the most buoyant hopes from ever leaving the ground.""

—The New York Times

""There are those rare writers in the world whose work unearths the stories that have been buried in and around us for so long. They force us to confront all that we would be rather not see, and ask us to reckon with why we have failed to see it for so long. Kiese Laymon is one such rare writer. Heavy is a memoir, yes, but it is also a testament to a sort of truth and self-reflection that is increasingly rare in our world today. If for some reason you were not already convinced, there should no longer be any doubt that Kiese Laymon is one of the important writers of our time.""

—Clint Smith, author of How the Word is Passed & Counting Descent

""Heavy is an act of truth telling unlike any other I can think of in American literature, partly due to Laymon's uniquely gifted mind—his ability to pursue the ways we lie to each other while also loving each other, or, not, and the humility he brings to bear while doing so, this consistently brings us back to life, to what matters in this world. Heavy is a gift to us, if we can pick it up—a moral exercise and an intimate history that is at the same time a story about America.""

9781984881427,The Country of the Blind,A Memoir at the End of Sight,"Living with retinitis pigmentosa means Andrew Leland exists in a unique threshold—he can see, but knows that sight is slipping away. Rather than simply waiting for darkness, he decides to investigate what lies ahead. This journey becomes far more than learning to navigate without vision; it's an immersion into an entire community with its own traditions, advocacy movements, and ways of understanding the world.

Leland approaches his future with genuine fascination, treating his condition as an invitation to discover rather than merely endure. His investigation reveals blindness not as absence but as a different way of experiencing life—one with its own wisdom and perspectives. Meanwhile, he grapples with how this transformation affects his closest relationships and his understanding of who he is.

Blending personal narrative with broader cultural examination, this book refuses to treat disability as tragedy. Instead, Leland finds richness in adaptation and meaning in community. His account balances honest vulnerability with infectious enthusiasm, showing how embracing uncertainty can lead to unexpected discoveries about resilience and belonging.","Leland chronicles his gradual transition from sight to blindness with curiosity and humor, discovering blindness as a rich culture with its own language and customs.

""This is such a gorgeous book. Andrew Leland manages to deftly balance the personal, historical and political as he documents—documents is too sterile a word; he gently sings about—his becoming blind. There is a great nonfiction book here about the history of blindness and the pioneers who have built a world of access and empowerment. But crucially, Leland weaves into that larger tapestry the deeply touching story of how he, his wife Lily, and his son Oscar face their myriad new challenges—with open minds and abundant wit, and always fearlessly together.""

This comprehensive biography reveals how a scrappy Irish-American from East Boston transformed himself into one of the most influential figures of his era, accumulating wealth and political clout across multiple industries and decades.

Kennedy's restless drive propelled him through an astonishing array of careers—from banking and shipyard management to Hollywood mogul and Wall Street financier. His political acumen earned him key roles in the New Deal administration, including leadership of the newly formed Securities and Exchange Commission. Yet his greatest aspiration, the presidency, remained forever out of reach.

The ambassador's isolationist views during the lead-up to World War II marked his dramatic downfall, transforming him from Washington insider to political pariah. But Kennedy's most enduring legacy lay in his children, particularly his sons who would achieve the political heights he never reached. The personal cost proved devastating—a father's dreams realized through unimaginable loss.

Drawing from unprecedented archival access, this biography illuminates both the man and the century that shaped him, revealing how one family's trajectory mirrors America's own complex evolution.","The definitive biography of Joseph P.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Kevin Sack chronicles how this single church became a beacon of Black resistance and faith in a city where enslaved Africans first touched American shores and the Civil War erupted.

Sack traces the congregation's defiant founding in 1817, when Black worshippers broke from white-controlled churches to create their own spiritual home. Through decades of persecution, from Civil War upheaval to Jim Crow terror, the church evolved into something unprecedented: a place where forgiveness became both theological doctrine and practical strategy for survival. The families' response to their loved ones' murders—extending grace to the killer—wasn't spontaneous but the culmination of generations who transformed suffering into strength.

This is ultimately a story about endurance and the particular form of Christianity that emerged from America's most brutal chapters.

Years later, when the Comanche way of life crumbles under American expansion, Eli emerges as a man caught between worlds—neither fully white nor Indian, but something entirely new.

Rachel Louise Snyder pulls back the curtain on intimate partner violence, revealing how this pervasive issue connects to everything from workplace productivity to school shootings to mass incarceration.

Drawing on extensive research and real-world cases, Snyder dismantles the dangerous assumptions that keep us from addressing this epidemic effectively. She challenges the notion that leaving an abusive relationship is simple, questions whether treatment programs actually work, and examines why our current support systems fall short. Her investigation takes readers inside courtrooms, police departments, and advocacy organizations to understand how domestic abuse ripples outward, affecting communities in ways we're only beginning to recognize.

Having spent years studying the brain and contemplating questions of human meaning through both literature and medicine, Kalanithi suddenly finds himself confronting his own finite existence.

The book traces his intellectual and emotional journey as someone who had dedicated his life to understanding what gives existence purpose and value. Now facing his own death while simultaneously becoming a father, he must reconcile the philosophical questions that had long fascinated him with the immediate reality of limited time.

Kalanithi examines the strange duality of his experience—intimate knowledge of mortality from a clinical perspective, yet complete unpreparedness for his own diagnosis. His reflections move between the technical realities of disease and treatment to deeper questions about legacy, love, and how we find meaning when certainty disappears. The memoir stands as both personal reckoning and broader meditation on the human condition, written by someone uniquely positioned to understand both sides of the doctor-patient relationship.","A neurosurgeon facing terminal cancer at thirty-six grapples with mortality, meaning, and new fatherhood.

Rather than attempting a traditional chronological biography, Powers approaches Mitchell through her perpetual motion—both physical and artistic. The book traces Mitchell's path from her polio-stricken childhood in rural Canada through her genre-defying musical transformations, examining how her collaborations and personal relationships shaped her art. Powers follows this trajectory all the way to Mitchell's recent creative resurgence following her life-threatening 2015 aneurysm.

Powers brings decades of music criticism expertise to bear on Mitchell's catalog, but she also interrogates the very nature of celebrity biography. How do we truly know an artist who has built her career on constant evolution?

Across more than two decades, she dissects the complex machinery of a partnership where creativity, ambition, and desire intersect in unexpected ways.

Groff interrogates how couples construct their shared mythology, examining the delicate balance between revelation and concealment that keeps relationships alive.

Safiya Sinclair chronicles her upbringing in a Rastafarian household where her father's interpretation of faith became a prison for the women in his family. His fear of Western corruption translated into severe restrictions: no modern clothing, no friendships, no independent thought.

Books became Sinclair's secret rebellion, smuggled to her by a mother who understood the power of words even as she remained trapped by circumstance. Education offered a pathway beyond the confines of prescribed womanhood, though each step toward intellectual freedom intensified the conflict at home. The memoir captures both the beauty and suffocation of a culture caught between spiritual tradition and oppressive control.

Sinclair's prose carries the musicality of her poetic background as she examines how religious fundamentalism can distort love into dominance. This is ultimately a story about the courage required to honor one's heritage while refusing to be diminished by it—a young woman's fight to claim her voice in a world determined to silence it.","Growing up under her militant Rastafarian father's oppressive control in Jamaica, Sinclair used poetry and education to break free from patriarchal traditions.

Clint Smith embarks on a deeply personal journey across the United States, visiting sites where the contradictions of American history live on in concrete and stone.

From Jefferson's Monticello—where ideals of freedom coexisted with the bondage of hundreds—to the Whitney Plantation's unflinching preservation of enslaved experiences, Smith uncovers stories that challenge comfortable narratives. His travels take him to Angola Prison, where the plantation-to-prison pipeline plays out across Louisiana farmland, and to Confederate burial grounds where memory itself becomes contested territory.

This isn't just historical excavation—it's an urgent examination of how the past shapes present realities. Smith reveals how slavery's influence permeates spaces we encounter daily: city streets built on auction blocks, holidays that celebrate liberation, monuments that sanitize brutality. Through conversations with tour guides, visitors, and community members, he demonstrates how Americans continue to grapple with inherited trauma and selective remembering.

Combining rigorous research with lyrical storytelling, Smith offers a framework for understanding how acknowledgment of difficult truths might lead toward healing rather than division.","Smith journeys from Monticello to Angola Prison, revealing how slavery's legacy hides in plain sight across America.

This stranger's offer of partnership forces the group's leader into an impossible position: accept help from someone whose values seem to contradict everything they stand for, or watch their movement collapse from lack of resources.

Catton constructs a tense examination of moral compromise, where survival demands difficult choices and trust becomes a luxury few can afford.

Fosse's creative genius produced legendary works including Chicago, Cabaret, and All That Jazz, establishing him as the sole individual to claim Oscar, Emmy, and Tony honors within a single year.

9780670025374,G-Man,J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century,"The name J. Edgar Hoover conjures images of authoritarian excess, yet this singular figure began his career as a promising young reformer determined to modernize American law enforcement. Beverly Gage's exhaustive biography traces how a middle-class Washington native transformed himself into one of the most influential—and controversial—power brokers in U.S. history.

For nearly five decades, Hoover wielded the FBI as both shield and sword, championing federal authority while systematically targeting those he deemed unworthy of American citizenship. His vision of national security was deeply selective: communists, civil rights leaders, and other perceived threats found themselves under relentless surveillance. Yet millions of Americans saw him as a patriotic guardian protecting traditional values.

Drawing on unprecedented access to previously classified materials, Gage constructs a complex portrait that resists easy categorization. This wasn't simply a story of unchecked power, but of how one man's contradictions—his genuine belief in government service alongside his willingness to abuse that service—shaped decades of American politics. Through Hoover's rise and reign, we see the evolution of federal authority, the machinery of surveillance, and the ongoing tensions between security and civil liberties that continue to define our political landscape.",Beverly Gage's monumental biography draws from never-before-seen sources to reveal how J.

Instead, the early 1990s unleashed forces of rage and division that would reshape the nation's political landscape for decades to come.

John Ganz chronicles this pivotal moment through the voices of insurgents and outsiders who challenged the established order. Pat Buchanan's fiery populism and Ross Perot's anti-establishment crusade exposed deep fractures in American society, while figures like David Duke exploited racial anxieties and conspiracy theories flourished in the heartland. From talk radio's inflammatory rhetoric to violent clashes in urban centers, the decade revealed a country grappling with economic uncertainty, demographic shifts, and the disorienting end of familiar Cold War certainties.

As traditional political coalitions splintered and new forms of extremism took root, intellectuals scrambled to decode the motivations driving Middle America's growing alienation. Bill Clinton's attempt to occupy the political center offered temporary stability, but the underlying tensions remained unresolved.

Eggers constructs a meditation on American masculinity adrift in an increasingly connected yet alienating world. Clay's predicament reflects the broader displacement felt by a generation caught between old certainties and new realities, where traditional markers of success no longer guarantee stability.

The novel examines what happens to individual identity when economic systems shift beneath our feet.

9781400041626,Hemingway's Boat,"Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost, 1934-1961","Ernest Hemingway's fishing cruiser serves as both sanctuary and witness to the author's tumultuous final chapter. Between 1934 and his death in 1961, the literary giant's existence oscillated between triumph and torment, with his boat remaining the single thread of continuity through it all.

The vessel became Hemingway's refuge from a world that simultaneously celebrated and consumed him. Here he pursued massive fish, hosted luminaries, and found moments of peace with his children. Yet the same deck that witnessed his joys also bore the weight of his deteriorating mental state, fractured relationships, and growing inability to write.

Beneath the familiar narrative of literary genius turned destructive celebrity lies a more complex portrait. Through fresh archival material and conversations with Hemingway's sons, a different man emerges—one capable of profound kindness toward struggling artists and broken souls. The most heartbreaking thread follows his relationship with his youngest son Gigi, whose gender identity struggles paralleled his father's own battles with authenticity and acceptance.

This examination reveals how creativity and self-destruction can coexist within the same person, offering neither condemnation nor absolution but rather an honest reckoning with human complexity.","Using Hemingway's beloved boat Pilar as an anchor point, Hendrickson traces the writer's final decades with remarkable nuance.

9780393609844,Unworthy Republic,The Dispossession of Native Americans and the Road to Indian Territory,"The 1830 Indian Removal Act promised orderly relocation of Native Americans beyond the Mississippi, framed by politicians as benevolent policy. Reality proved devastatingly different. Claudio Saunt excavates the true machinery behind this mass displacement, revealing how bureaucratic systems designed for efficiency instead enabled widespread death, theft, and brutality.

Through meticulous examination of federal archives and survivor testimonies, Saunt demonstrates that removal was never inevitable—it was a calculated political gamble. Southern legislators pushed the policy to open vast territories for plantation agriculture, while Indigenous communities mounted fierce resistance and many Americans condemned the betrayal of national principles.

The narrow congressional victory unleashed one of history's earliest examples of state-orchestrated ethnic cleansing. Administrative chaos compounded deliberate cruelty as 80,000 people were torn from ancestral lands. Saunt traces how racial ideology and economic ambition converged to justify systematic violence, exposing the corruption and incompetence that turned policy into catastrophe. This rigorous historical investigation connects nineteenth-century choices to contemporary America, showing how the foundations of white supremacy were built through government-sanctioned dispossession.","Saunt chronicles the brutal reality behind Indian Removal—the 1830s policy that forcibly displaced 80,000 Native Americans.

Åsne Seierstad reconstructs the events of July 22, 2011, through an unflinching examination of both perpetrator and victims.

Seierstad traces Anders Behring Breivik's transformation from a middle-class Oslo youth into a mass murderer driven by extremist ideology. Her investigation reveals how isolation, online radicalization, and a warped sense of patriotism converged to create a terrorist who believed he was saving his country. Equally important are the portraits of those who died—young people committed to democratic ideals and social justice, whose futures were cut short by violence.

This is both a meticulous reconstruction of a national tragedy and a broader meditation on how hatred takes root. Seierstad exposes the fragility of peaceful societies and the human cost of extremism, creating a work that functions as both memorial and warning. The result is journalism that bears witness to unthinkable loss while refusing to look away from difficult truths about radicalization and its consequences.","Seierstad delivers a devastating account of the 2011 Norway attacks, examining both the terrorist's radicalization and his victims' lives.

Marlon James constructs a kaleidoscopic narrative that spans three tumultuous decades, giving voice to killers, politicians, spies, and spirits who witnessed the island's descent into chaos.

The novel refuses simple answers about that December night in 1976, instead diving deep into the complex web of Cold War politics, gang warfare, and social upheaval that defined modern Jamaica. Characters migrate from Kingston's volatile neighborhoods to New York's drug-ravaged streets, carrying their traumas and secrets across borders and years.

James orchestrates a symphony of perspectives, each narrator revealing fragments of a larger truth about power, survival, and the cycles of violence that trap entire generations.

Against this backdrop of political upheaval, she discovers her wife's secret collaborations with cultural luminaries like Bowie, Waits, Sontag, and Acker—relationships that reveal a pattern of calculated reinvention.

As CM pieces together fragments of her wife's past, from European origins to cross-continental artistic ventures, she confronts the devastating possibility that their entire relationship was built on lies.

9780525657743,Crying in H Mart,A Memoir,"Michelle Zauner's memoir traces the complex threads connecting food, identity, and loss in the Korean American experience. Growing up in Eugene, Oregon, Zauner felt caught between worlds—neither fully Korean nor fully American—while navigating her mother's cultural expectations and her own coming-of-age struggles.

The kitchen becomes sacred ground where three generations of women forge their deepest connections. Late-night meals in her grandmother's Seoul apartment and shared recipes create a language of love that transcends words. Yet as Zauner pursues music and builds an independent life on the East Coast, these cultural ties seem to fade.

Everything shifts when her mother receives a terminal cancer diagnosis. Faced with impending loss, Zauner discovers that cooking traditional Korean dishes offers a pathway back to her heritage and a means of honoring her mother's legacy. Through intimate portraits of family meals and the rituals of caregiving, she examines how we inherit not just recipes but entire ways of being in the world.

This memoir captures the particular ache of losing a parent while simultaneously finding yourself, revealing how the act of preparing food can become both an expression of grief and a form of cultural reclamation.","From Japanese Breakfast's Michelle Zauner comes a luminous memoir exploring Korean American identity through the lens of food and family. When her mother's terminal illness forces a reckoning with heritage, cooking becomes both grief and healing.",256,,Biography & Autobiography / Asian & Asian American,Knopf,20/04/2021,Michelle Zauner,"Michelle Zauner leads the celebrated indie pop project Japanese Breakfast, earning widespread recognition for her musical artistry.

Leah, Natalie, Felix, and Nathan each grapple with questions of belonging and authenticity in a city that promises mobility but often delivers isolation.

Smith constructs a mosaic of contemporary London life, where gentrification reshapes neighborhoods and personal relationships alike. The novel examines how geography shapes identity—both the physical spaces we inhabit and the psychological territories we defend. Through fragmented narratives and shifting perspectives, the story reveals the tensions between aspiration and origin, showing how the desire to transcend one's circumstances can create unexpected forms of entrapment.

This is urban fiction that refuses easy answers, presenting London as both sanctuary and maze. Smith's formal innovations mirror the disjointed experience of modern city living, where connection and alienation exist in constant tension.","Four Londoners who grew up in the same council estate navigate adulthood, class divides, and shifting identities.

Despite her lack of faith, she settles into this contemplative existence, drawn to its simplicity and distance from her former world.

Her fragile peace dissolves as three disturbing forces converge. A relentless mouse invasion transforms daily life into a surreal battle for survival. The discovery of human bones—identified as her long-lost sister—resurrects painful questions about family and loss. An unexpected arrival from her past threatens to expose the very secrets she sought to escape.

This Booker Prize-shortlisted work examines the human impulse to flee from pain and the impossibility of outrunning our deepest wounds. Through quiet observation and careful prose, it questions whether true sanctuary exists anywhere but within ourselves, and whether redemption requires confronting rather than avoiding the ghosts that haunt us.","Seeking refuge in a remote religious community, a woman confronts three unsettling events: a mouse plague, her sister's discovered remains, and a visitor from her past.

The Continental Army has endured devastating losses, while across the ocean, Britain grapples with mounting costs and the looming threat of European powers entering the fray.

Rick Atkinson chronicles this decisive period through multiple lenses: Franklin's delicate diplomatic dance in Versailles, Washington's relentless struggle to keep his forces equipped and fed, and British commanders questioning whether victory remains achievable. The narrative weaves together legendary confrontations—Brandywine's chaos, Saratoga's turning point, Monmouth's brutal heat—with the quiet heroism of Valley Forge's winter ordeal.

Beyond military strategy and political maneuvering, this account examines the profound sacrifices required to birth a democracy. Atkinson reveals how ordinary colonists, soldiers, and leaders confronted impossible choices that would determine their nation's fate. The result illuminates not just pivotal battles, but the character of a people willing to risk everything for an untested ideal of self-governance.","The Revolution's brutal middle years, when Washington's army fought on the knife's edge between survival and annihilation.

Monique discovers the double-edged nature of viral fame after challenging institutional racism, and Nakia fights to establish her restaurant while resisting family expectations about her choices.

Spanning two decades from the late 2000s to the late 2020s, their stories unfold against a backdrop of political turmoil, economic uncertainty, and environmental crisis. As external pressures mount and personal challenges evolve, these women must determine what their bond means and whether it can survive the transformations that come with growing up.

""A rangy novel, crisscrossing the continent to trace the fates of five friends as they navigate relationships, career pivots and entrenchments, and the loss of or estrangement from family. The Wilderness uses social events (recent racial reckonings, the pandemic) as material but has a more seasoned perspective than that of novels written in their immediate wake. The gestation of this book seems to have served it well in that respect, giving it a wisdom—worn lightly and with humor—on the promise and reality of historic inflection points and how a tightly knit group might respond to them differently.""

9780871403131,Shirley Jackson,A Rather Haunted Life,"Despite creating one of America's most famous short stories, Shirley Jackson remained oddly marginalized in literary circles for decades after her death. Ruth Franklin's biography corrects this oversight by positioning Jackson as a master of psychological terror who captured the anxieties of 1950s America with unmatched precision.

Franklin traces Jackson's development of what she terms ""domestic horror"" – fiction that found menace in everyday family life and suburban conformity. Long before feminism became a movement, Jackson's work exposed the suffocating realities many women faced behind closed doors. Her stories transformed ordinary households into spaces of dread and revelation.

The biography also examines the contradictions that defined Jackson's own existence. While crafting tales of isolation and madness, she maintained a public life as a faculty wife and mother in a Vermont college town. Yet this seemingly conventional existence masked growing personal turmoil – a deteriorating marriage, escalating mental health struggles, and increasing dependence on prescription drugs.

Drawing on newly available letters and extensive interviews, Franklin constructs a nuanced portrait that honors both Jackson's literary achievements and her complex humanity. The result positions Jackson not as a curiosity but as an essential voice in American fiction.","Ruth Franklin's masterful biography rescues Shirley Jackson from literary obscurity, revealing how the author of The Lottery and The Haunting of Hill House pioneered domestic horror while navigating the contradictions of mid-century American womanhood.",624,,Biography & Autobiography / Literary Figures,Liveright,27/09/2016,Ruth Franklin,"Ruth Franklin has written extensively about literature and culture, including A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction, which received recognition as a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature. Her biographical work Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life earned the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography. Franklin makes her home in Brooklyn, NY.","""With this welcome new biography Franklin makes a thoughtful and persuasive case for Jackson as a serious and accomplished literary artist. . . . [Franklin] sees Jackson not as an oddball, one-off writer of horror tales and ghost stories but as someone belonging to the great tradition of Hawthorne, Poe and James, writers preoccupied, as she was, with inner evil in the human soul.""

—Charles McGrath, The New York Times

""Ruth Franklin's sympathetic and masterful biography both uncovers Jackson's secret and haunting life and repositions her as a major artist whose fiction so uncannily channeled women's nightmares and contradictions that it is 'nothing less than the secret history of American women of her era.'""

—Elaine Showalter, The Washington Post

""This meticulous biography tackles the work of Shirley Jackson with the kind of studied seriousness some might give to a male titan of history like Robert Moses. And thank goddess for that, as Ruth Franklin wisely rescues Shirley Jackson from any semblance of obscurity. Despite her well-documented magnetism (and dalliances in the dark arts) Jackson's work was often dismissed as mere genre nonsense or, worse yet, women's fiction and Franklin's sensitive, witty and rigorous work makes an airtight case for just why this isn't right. The ire Jackson's short stories inspired in New Yorker readers is only a hint of the drama and intensity that characterized her short but beguiling life, with Franklin captures with a hefty dose of wit and suspense. One of the best literary biographies I've ever encountered.""

Yet surviving the ocean proves to be only the beginning of his ordeal. The same rebellious spirit that once got him into trouble as a boy, then propelled him toward Olympic glory, now becomes his lifeline against impossible odds.

The nuns face starvation and disease, their institution forgotten by a world that has little use for women who don't conform to expected roles.

What begins as exile becomes transformation. Marie finds herself drawn to the radical possibilities of collective female power, her mystical visions guiding her toward an unprecedented reimagining of religious life. Drawing on the warrior blood that runs through her veins, she begins to forge something entirely new—a sanctuary where women might live and create on their own terms.

Groff constructs a world where spiritual ecstasy and earthly desire intertwine, where the boundaries between the holy and the human blur beyond recognition. Marie's story becomes a meditation on what happens when visionary leadership meets institutional resistance, and whether one woman's revolutionary dreams can survive in a world determined to crush female autonomy. The novel pulses with questions about creativity, community, and the price of refusing to accept the limitations others would impose.","Exiled from Eleanor of Aquitaine's court, teenage Marie de France transforms a dying abbey into a radical sanctuary.

9780307592736,Wild,From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,"Loss has a way of stripping life down to its bare essentials, and for Cheryl Strayed, that meant confronting an impossible question: how do you rebuild when everything familiar has disappeared? Her answer defied all logic—tackle over a thousand miles of wilderness trail with zero hiking experience and a pack so heavy she could barely lift it.

The Pacific Crest Trail becomes both adversary and teacher as Strayed navigates far more than just difficult terrain. Between encounters with wildlife, equipment failures, and the relentless physical demands of the journey, she grapples with grief, guilt, and the messy aftermath of a life derailed. What emerges is neither a simple tale of triumph nor a neat resolution to pain, but something more honest—a reckoning with what it means to choose forward motion when standing still feels safer.

Strayed's voice carries the reader through moments of genuine danger and unexpected grace with equal measure, finding humor in disaster and wisdom in stubbornness. This isn't about conquering mountains or discovering some hidden version of yourself; it's about the ordinary miracle of putting one foot in front of the other when that's the only option left.","Following her mother's death and the collapse of her marriage, Cheryl Strayed embarks on an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail.

With its vivid descriptions of beautiful but unforgiving terrain, Wild is a cinematic story, but Strayed's book isn't really about big, cathartic moments. The author never 'finds herself' or gets healed. When she reaches the trail's end, she buys a cheap ice cream cone and continues down the road. . . .

Living in Minneapolis, on the verge of divorcing her husband, Strayed was still reeling from the sudden death four years before of her mother; the ensuing years formed an erratic, confused time 'like a crackling Fourth of July sparkler.' Hiking the trail helped decide what direction her life would take, even though she had never seriously hiked or carried a pack before. . . . Eventually she began to experience 'a kind of strange, abstract, retrospective fun,' meeting the few other hikers along the way, all male; jettisoning some of the weight from her pack and burning books she had read; and encountering all manner of creature and acts of nature, from rock slides to snow.

Through intimate portraits and meticulous research, this investigation reveals the gaps between clinical frameworks and lived reality.

The narrative weaves together disparate lives: a revered healer in Indian temples whose visions challenge Western medical assumptions, a mother rebuilding relationships after emerging from psychosis, a man waging war against the analysts who failed him, and a young woman questioning whether her diagnosis has become her cage. Each story illuminates how psychiatric labels can both illuminate and obscure the complexity of human experience.

At the book's heart lies the author's own reckoning with childhood hospitalization and a friendship formed in a psychiatric ward—two parallel trajectories that ultimately diverge in devastating ways. This personal thread anchors broader questions about how diagnostic categories shape not just treatment, but identity itself. The result is an unflinching examination of medicine's reach and its limitations, revealing the stubborn mystery that remains at the core of consciousness and suffering.","What happens when psychiatric explanations fail to capture who we really are?

9781416590316,Frederick Douglass,Prophet of Freedom,"Frederick Douglass stands as perhaps the most extraordinary figure in American letters—a man who transformed himself from enslaved property into the nation's most commanding voice for freedom. This comprehensive biography illuminates how Douglass wielded his remarkable intellect and oratory skills to demolish the very foundations of slavery, becoming both America's harshest critic and its most devoted believer in democratic ideals.

Blight reveals the intricate layers of Douglass's character: the brilliant strategist who understood that his own story could serve as irrefutable evidence of Black intellectual capacity, the complex family man navigating two marriages, and the aging leader who sometimes clashed with a new generation of civil rights activists. Drawing from newly available letters and Douglass's own newspaper archives, this portrait captures both the towering public intellectual and the private individual wrestling with fame, family, and an evolving America.

More than a traditional biography, this work demonstrates how one person's relentless pursuit of literacy and justice reshaped a nation's conscience, offering fresh insights into the man whose life embodied both the promise and contradictions of American democracy.","The definitive biography of Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery to become America's greatest 19th-century orator and a towering abolitionist.

Mungo finds himself drawn to James, whose devotion to his racing pigeons offers a rare glimpse of beauty in their harsh surroundings. Their connection deepens into something neither fully understands but both desperately need.

Their stolen moments together become a refuge from the violence that marks their daily lives. But secrets have consequences in a place where difference can mean danger. The story moves between Mungo's present crisis—trapped on an isolated fishing expedition with men whose intentions grow increasingly unclear—and the events that led him there.

Stuart crafts an intimate examination of first love shadowed by the weight of family loyalty, religious hatred, and economic desperation. The novel asks whether tenderness can survive in a world built on division, and what price young people pay for the chance to become themselves.","Two boys from opposite sides of Glasgow's sectarian divide fall in love amid violence and poverty.

9780358726470,Water Mirror Echo,Bruce Lee and the Making of Asian America,"Bruce Lee died at thirty-two, but his cultural impact continues to reverberate decades later. Beyond the martial arts legend and Hollywood aspirations lies a more complex figure: a child of two worlds who navigated identity in ways that would reshape American culture itself.

This biography strips away the mythmaking to examine Lee's actual journey—from his birth in a racially divided San Francisco to his formative years in Hong Kong during wartime, and finally his return to an America undergoing profound social change. Chang traces how Lee's unique position allowed him to challenge existing boundaries and help establish new possibilities for Asian American identity.

Drawing on previously unavailable personal materials, family photographs, and conversations with those who knew Lee intimately, Chang constructs a portrait that balances the individual with the historical moment. The book argues that Lee's significance extends beyond entertainment—his visibility and cultural bridging helped catalyze the emergence of Asian America as a concept and community. Rather than simply celebrating an icon, this work examines how one person's navigation of cultural complexity can create lasting change.","Jeff Chang excavates the man behind the Bruce Lee mythology, revealing how a curious kid from segregated San Francisco became both global icon and catalyst for Asian America.

The narrative moves between memory and revelation, examining the intricate bonds that connect mothers and sons across cultural divides. Little Dog confronts difficult truths about identity, belonging, and the weight of generational trauma while celebrating the fierce love that has sustained his family.

Vuong crafts a meditation on language itself—its power to bridge impossible distances and its failure to capture certain truths. The novel interrogates what it means to claim your own voice in a world that often refuses to listen, transforming silence into song and pain into profound understanding.

Through meticulous reporting spanning nearly a decade, this book reveals how one extraordinary girl navigates systems designed to fail her—from overcrowded shelters to underfunded schools.

The narrative traces connections across generations, linking Dasani's struggles to her family's deeper history of displacement and survival. As she shoulders responsibilities far beyond her years, protecting younger siblings while pursuing her own dreams, Dasani embodies both the failures of American social policy and the unbreakable bonds of family loyalty.

The story reaches a crossroads when opportunity arrives in the form of an elite boarding school—but success demands sacrifices that threaten to sever the very relationships that define her.

At sixteen, these skills become essential for survival as she navigates Michigan's waterways in search of her disappeared mother, carrying little more than a boat, basic supplies, and a book about sharpshooter Annie Oakley.

The rivers that once offered childhood refuge now present constant threats to a young woman alone. Campbell examines how violence shapes identity and tests the boundaries between victim and survivor. As Margo encounters the complex characters inhabiting rural Michigan's margins, she must decide which parts of herself to preserve and which to sacrifice.

This coming-of-age story interrogates the true cost of independence and the weight of family legacy.

The title comes from a killer's own justification—words that reveal how ordinary people rationalize extraordinary brutality. Evangelista examines the machinery of state violence and the psychology that enables it, showing how quickly the value of human life can be redefined by those in power.

This is journalism as literature, combining rigorous reporting with deeply personal reflection. Evangelista doesn't just document what happened; she interrogates why societies accept such violence and how individuals navigate moral collapse.

The resulting tension exposes the fault lines between artistic ambition and domestic reality, between the stories we tell ourselves and the lives we actually inhabit.

9781631498831,On Juneteenth,,"The declaration of freedom that reached Texas on June 19, 1865, marks more than just a date—it represents the complex intersection of personal identity, regional mythology, and national reckoning. Through the lens of Juneteenth, this work dismantles the familiar narratives of Texas exceptionalism to reveal how enslaved people and their descendants shaped the state's trajectory from its earliest days.

Rather than accepting the romanticized tales of cowboys and oil wealth, the author traces her own family's presence in Texas back to the 1820s, using their story to illuminate broader patterns of resistance, survival, and contribution that have been systematically erased from popular memory. The analysis moves beyond the Alamo mythology to demonstrate how the economics of human bondage drove not only Texas independence but also sparked wider conflicts that would ultimately tear the nation apart.

This examination arrives at a moment when America has finally recognized June 19th as a federal holiday, yet the work serves as both celebration and warning.

9780062183637,Lost Girls,An Unsolved American Mystery,"The disappearance of Shannan Gilbert in 2010 exposed a tragedy far larger than anyone imagined. Her frantic flight through an exclusive Long Island community that spring night seemed like an isolated incident involving a young escort—until investigators stumbled upon something chilling months later.

Four bodies discovered along a desolate stretch of highway revealed the work of a serial killer, yet Shannan remained missing. The victims—Maureen, Melissa, Megan, and Amber—shared disturbing similarities: young women who had traveled to Long Island seeking work in the sex trade, all found wrapped in burlap and carefully positioned.

Robert Kolker reconstructs not just a criminal investigation, but the complex lives of five women whose deaths might have gone unnoticed. He examines how the digital age created new vulnerabilities, how society's blind spots enabled tragedy, and how families fought for recognition that their daughters mattered.

As Jake builds a life in this bygone era, falling deeply in love and becoming part of a community, he discovers that history resists change with increasing violence.

9780063112049,By the Fire We Carry,The Generations-Long Fight for Justice on Native Land,"A murder case from the 1990s becomes the unlikely catalyst for one of the most significant Indigenous rights victories in modern American history. The crime: a Muscogee citizen killing another tribal member on what may or may not have been reservation land. The question: did Oklahoma have the right to prosecute, or did jurisdiction belong to the tribe?

This legal puzzle unravels more than a century of governmental betrayal. In the 1830s, the Muscogee people faced forced removal at gunpoint, driven from ancestral homes with promises of permanent new territory. Those promises crumbled when Oklahoma statehood erased their reservation from official recognition.

Rebecca Nagle traces how this forgotten history collided with contemporary jurisprudence, culminating in a 2020 Supreme Court decision that restored nearly half of Oklahoma to tribal jurisdiction. Through meticulous research and personal connection to the Cherokee Nation, she reveals how Indigenous communities have fought tirelessly to reclaim what was stolen, transforming legal defeats into unexpected victories that reshape our understanding of sovereignty, justice, and the ongoing struggle for Native rights in America.",How a small-town murder in the 1990s led to a Supreme Court case that redrew the map of Oklahoma.

9781631494420,Audience of One,"Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America","The rise of Donald Trump cannot be understood without examining America's relationship with television itself. James Poniewozik argues that decades of media evolution created the perfect storm for a reality TV star to capture the presidency.

This cultural analysis reveals how television transformed from a unifying force in mid-20th century America into today's fragmented digital landscape of endless channels and online echo chambers. Within this shifting media environment, Trump evolved as the ultimate TV creation—a figure who understood instinctively how to manipulate cameras, headlines, and public attention.

Poniewozik chronicles Trump's metamorphosis through different media eras: the tabloid celebrity of the 1980s, the self-aware entertainer of the 1990s, the reality show boss of the 2000s, and finally the Twitter-obsessed political performer. Each reinvention reflected television's own changes, until Trump became less a person than a living embodiment of media itself.

The book examines how politics and entertainment merged into a single spectacle, where governing became performance and controversy became currency. Poniewozik dissects this phenomenon with sharp wit and cultural insight, showing how America elected not just a president, but television itself to the highest office.",An incisive cultural history that captures a fractious nation through the prism of television and the rattled mind of a celebrity president.,304,,Political Science / Political Process / Media & Internet,Liveright,10/09/2019,James Poniewozik,"James Poniewozik serves as chief television critic for the New York Times, a position he has held since 2015.

The author chronicles Trump’s actions against a deeply insightful history of vast changes in the media and popular culture during the period.... This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base.""—Kirkus

""Caustic, scintillating cultural history…. New York Times television critic Poniewozik sets Donald Trump’s political rise against American television’s evolution…. Trump’s own media persona—'the blunt, impolite apex predator’ on The Apprentice, the trash-talking bully in pro-wrestling cameos, the birther conspiracy theorist on Fox News guest spots—shaped his political style and then subsumed him entirely: Trump became ‘a cable news channel in human form: loud, short of attention span, and addicted to conflict,’ Poniewozik writes. ‘TV became president.’ Poniewozik’s trenchant, brilliantly witty critique of the cultural archetypes percolating into American politics is one of the best analyses yet of the Trump era.""—Publishers Weekly

Crushed by student loans and living in an Oakland squat, she knows almost nothing about her past—not her father's identity, not why her reclusive mother lives under a false name, not how to escape the uncertainty that defines her existence.

A chance meeting opens an unexpected door: an internship with the Sunlight Project, a secretive organization that specializes in exposing hidden truths. Led by Andreas Wolf, a magnetic former East German activist now hiding in South America, the group promises access to information that could unlock the mysteries of Pip's family history. But Andreas's interest in her runs deeper than professional mentorship, challenging everything she believes about morality and justice.

Franzen constructs a labyrinthine narrative that spans generations and continents, connecting the personal struggles of parents and children with larger questions about transparency, power, and the price of truth.

These blazes tear through landscapes once considered fireproof, burn year-round, and create their own devastating weather systems.

Jordan Thomas takes readers inside this apocalyptic reality through his experiences with the Los Padres Hotshots, an elite firefighting crew tasked with confronting the unconquerable. His account of one punishing fire season reveals the physical and psychological toll of battling infernos that have evolved beyond human control.

Beyond the immediate drama of firefighting, Thomas excavates the deeper story of how fire transformed from humanity's ancient ally into an existential threat. He traces this shift through colonial suppression of Indigenous burning practices, misguided forest management policies, and the rise of a massive firefighting apparatus that may be fighting the wrong war entirely.

This is both an intimate portrait of extraordinary courage under extreme conditions and a clear-eyed examination of climate change's most visible frontier. Thomas combines rigorous research with lived experience to illuminate how we might forge a different relationship with fire—one that acknowledges both its destructive power and its essential role in healthy ecosystems.","Wildland firefighter and anthropologist Jordan Thomas chronicles one brutal fire season with California's elite hotshot crew.

The vacation renters must decide whether to trust these unexpected arrivals, while the homeowners grapple with their own displacement. As uncertainty deepens and the outside world remains ominously silent, tensions simmer between the adults while their children navigate this strange new reality.

Alam constructs a psychological pressure cooker that forces characters—and readers—to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, assumptions, and survival instincts.

What emerged was something both beautiful and unsettling—prose that captured grief in ways that felt simultaneously authentic and artificial. This moment becomes the lens through which Vauhini Vara examines our increasingly intertwined relationship with digital technology.

Vara traces her own digital evolution alongside the rise of tech giants, from early internet chat rooms to her groundbreaking coverage of Facebook for the Wall Street Journal. Her personal history becomes a mirror for how Silicon Valley has quietly colonized our most intimate spaces—our thoughts, relationships, and creative processes.

The book weaves together fragments of digital life: search histories, product reviews, social media interactions, and that original viral AI experiment. Through this collage, Vara reveals how tech companies have monetized human vulnerability while promising connection and empowerment.

Yet this isn't simply a cautionary tale. Vara argues that understanding these systems—how they work, who profits, and what they cost us—opens possibilities for reclaiming agency.

This bequest drags him back into relationships he'd assumed were safely buried in his past—friendships from school days that ended in tragedy and betrayal.

As Tony attempts to understand why he's been remembered in someone's will, he discovers that his recollections of crucial events don't align with reality. The comfortable narrative he's built around his younger self begins to crumble, exposing uncomfortable truths about his actions and their consequences.

Barnes transforms this midlife reckoning into something far more unsettling than a simple trip down memory lane. The real investigation isn't into what happened decades ago, but into how Tony has edited his own history to preserve his self-image. Each revelation strips away another layer of comfortable self-deception, revealing the gap between who we think we are and who we actually were.

Linda Villarosa's investigative work uncovers the disturbing reality that medical education and practice remain tainted by centuries-old myths about racial differences in physiology.

The statistics are staggering and undeniable. A highly educated Black woman faces the same maternal mortality risks as a white woman who never finished middle school. These aren't isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern where Black patients consistently receive inferior care and experience worse outcomes across all medical specialties.

Villarosa traces how environmental injustices compound these medical inequities, as Black neighborhoods bear disproportionate exposure to toxins and pollutants. Perhaps most devastating is her examination of how the chronic stress of navigating racism literally accelerates aging at the cellular level.

Through meticulous research and deeply personal narratives, this work exposes how slavery's pseudoscientific justifications continue to influence modern medicine. The result is a healthcare apartheid that costs thousands of lives annually, demanding urgent reform of institutions that claim to heal but often harm.","Villarosa exposes the systemic racism embedded in American healthcare, revealing how historical assumptions and daily discrimination create deadly disparities.

9781501191053,Master Slave Husband Wife,An Epic Journey from Slavery to Freedom,"Love and ingenuity collide in this remarkable account of two enslaved people who refused to accept their fate. Ellen and William Craft devised an audacious plan that would test every assumption about race, gender, and power in antebellum America. Their scheme required Ellen to transform herself completely, adopting a disguise so convincing it would fool everyone from fellow passengers to hotel clerks across a thousand-mile journey.

What began as a desperate bid for liberty transformed the couple into unlikely celebrities, their story captivating audiences from Boston to Philadelphia. Yet fame brought its own perils. The couple discovered that freedom in America remained fragile, especially as new laws turned every citizen into a potential bounty hunter. Their triumph became a catalyst for a larger reckoning about what it truly meant to be free in a nation built on contradictions.

Ilyon Woo reconstructs not just an escape, but a series of reinventions that would challenge everything Americans believed about themselves. This is history that reads like a thriller, revealing how two people's refusal to remain invisible helped expose the moral bankruptcy of an entire system.","The extraordinary true story of Ellen and William Craft, an enslaved couple who staged a daring 1,000-mile escape in 1848, posing as master and slave.

A calculating American operative arrives in rural France with a mission to destabilize a group of environmental activists. Her methods are precise: seduce a naive Parisian intellectual, embed herself within the commune, and execute her handlers' increasingly dangerous demands.

Yet the countryside holds unexpected mysteries. Among prehistoric caves and crumbling farmsteads, she discovers Bruno Lacombe, an enigmatic figure whose radical ideas about humanity's future lie buried in its distant past. His unconventional theories begin to unravel her certainties about control and purpose.

As surveillance becomes fascination, the spy finds herself caught between competing visions of human nature. Her corporate masters demand results, her unwitting targets trust her completely, and Bruno's seductive philosophies challenge everything she thought she understood about civilization itself.

9780374279295,King,A Life,"Drawing on previously classified government documents, this biography presents Martin Luther King Jr. as both revolutionary leader and deeply human figure grappling with personal demons. Rather than offering another hagiographic account, this work reveals a man caught between his public role as advocate for nonviolence and his private battles with depression and self-doubt.

The narrative traces King's evolution from young minister to national figure, examining how government surveillance shaped his final years while he expanded his focus beyond civil rights to economic inequality and anti-war activism. This portrait challenges readers to confront the gap between the sanitized version of King often presented in popular memory and the radical thinker who understood that true equality required dismantling systemic oppression.

What emerges is a figure whose internal contradictions mirror those of the nation he sought to transform—a man whose marriage suffered under the weight of his mission, whose faith was tested by violence and hatred, yet who persisted in believing that moral force could overcome entrenched power. This account positions King not as a distant saint, but as someone whose struggles with doubt and determination remain strikingly relevant to contemporary movements for justice.",The first major MLK biography in decades draws on newly declassified FBI files to reveal the complex human being behind the icon.

Their enigmatic music teacher offers them an impossible choice: perform a sequence of mystical challenges, and they might reclaim their interrupted lives. The catch? Absolute secrecy about their otherworldly experience.

Their return from death doesn't go unnoticed. Ancient forces and supernatural entities descend upon Lovesend, each pursuing hidden objectives that threaten to unravel the fragile fabric of the community.

Behind the viral letter that changed California law and led to a judge's recall was a young woman navigating the complex aftermath of trauma within a system that often fails survivors.

This memoir reveals the stark reality of what happens after the cameras stop rolling and the headlines fade. Despite having what many considered an ideal case—witnesses, evidence, a clear perpetrator—the author's journey through isolation and self-doubt exposes how even the most supported victims struggle against institutional barriers and cultural attitudes that prioritize protecting the accused.

Miller's account dissects the machinery of a justice system built to minimize rather than heal, while simultaneously celebrating the transformative power of finding one's voice. Her narrative weaves together moments of devastating vulnerability with unexpected humor and hard-won wisdom, creating a testament to human resilience that refuses to let trauma define the survivor. This is both an indictment of systemic failures and a celebration of the words that can reshape our understanding of justice, healing, and what it means to reclaim one's story.","Miller reclaims her identity after being known only as Emily Doe, transforming her experience of assault and the Stanford trial into a luminous memoir about survival and the power of speaking truth.",368,,Biography & Autobiography / Women,Viking,24/09/2019,Chanel Miller,"Chanel Miller graduated with a BA in Literature from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and works as both a writer and artist.

Francis Blundy recites an original poem to his wife, unaware that this single evening will spawn decades of scholarly debate and obsession. The poem disappears without a trace, leaving only questions in its wake.

Fast-forward to 2119: climate catastrophe has reshaped civilization, and much of the old world lies beneath rising waters. Thomas Metcalfe, an isolated academic in flooded England, fixates on the lost cultural treasures of the early 21st century. His search for Blundy's vanished verse pulls him into a web of passion, deception, and violence that challenges his understanding of truth itself.

McEwan constructs a narrative that functions simultaneously as romantic thriller and philosophical inquiry.

Shacochis constructs a narrative that examines how personal choices intersect with historical forces, revealing the hidden costs of America's global reach.

Her grandparents endured missionary boarding schools designed to strip away their Quechan and Laguna Pueblo heritage. Her parents left reservation life behind for government job programs that promised economic mobility through cultural erasure.

But growing up between worlds—born on California's Yuma reservation, raised in Navajo country—Taffa begins to see the cracks in this inherited wisdom. Her memoir weaves together childhood recollections from the 1970s and 80s with incisive analysis of federal policies, the Red Power movement, and the ongoing criminalization of Native communities.

Taffa examines how her mixed-tribe identity fits within both pan-Indian solidarity and specific tribal belonging. She traces the personal costs of assimilation alongside its broader historical violence, revealing how Native stories remain absent from America's foundational narratives. With wit and unflinching honesty, she interrogates whether the promise of acceptance ever delivers what it claims—and what her family lost believing it would.","Growing up between reservation and mainstream America, Taffa questions the promise of assimilation her family embraced.

Claire Burwell, the jury's only widow, initially champions Khan's vision, but her support wavers as media scrutiny intensifies and pressure mounts from grieving families, politicians, and activists with competing agendas. The controversy forces each participant to confront uncomfortable truths about prejudice, patriotism, and the complex process of collective healing.

Waldman constructs a nuanced examination of how personal trauma intersects with public memory, revealing the fault lines that emerge when a diverse city attempts to forge consensus from grief.

Three survivors emerge from the wreckage to face an impossible situation: trapped in dense jungle terrain, surrounded by indigenous tribes who have never encountered outsiders, and cut off from any hope of immediate rescue.

What unfolds is a remarkable test of human endurance and cross-cultural encounter. The survivors must overcome not only the physical challenges of navigating treacherous wilderness while injured and ill-equipped, but also the delicate dynamics of first contact with a people whose way of life has remained unchanged for millennia.

9780300244052,The Rediscovery of America,Native Peoples and the Unmaking of U.S. History,"American history textbooks have traditionally relegated Indigenous peoples to footnotes, treating them as obstacles rather than active participants in the nation's development. Ned Blackhawk fundamentally challenges this narrative by positioning Native nations at the center of America's story across five transformative centuries.

This groundbreaking work reveals how Indigenous communities consistently influenced major historical turning points that shaped the continent. From early colonial encounters through contemporary legal battles, Native peoples emerge not as passive victims but as strategic actors who repeatedly altered the trajectory of American development. Blackhawk traces these interconnections through pivotal moments: how Indigenous resistance affected European imperial strategies, the role of tribal politics in sparking revolutionary conflicts, and the ways Native activism transformed modern legal frameworks.

The result is a radically different understanding of American identity itself. Rather than viewing Indigenous history as separate from mainstream narratives, Blackhawk shows how Native experiences illuminate the true complexity of American development, revealing patterns of resilience and adaptation that continue to reshape the nation today.","Five centuries of American history retold with Indigenous peoples at the center.

9780316545792,Deep House,The Gayest Love Story Ever Told,"In the shadow of anti-gay legislation that could separate countless couples, two men navigate love across borders and boundaries. Jeremy Atherton Lin chronicles his relationship with a British partner during a pivotal moment in LGBTQ+ history, as the Defense of Marriage Act threatens to criminalize their very existence together.

Their romance unfolds across continents and underground scenes—from clandestine retreats in nature to the pulsing nightlife of international cities. But this isn't just their story alone. Lin excavates the hidden histories of gay men who fought similar battles across generations, revealing a rich tapestry of resistance, survival, and defiance.

The narrative moves fluidly between intimate moments of domestic life and the broader political machinery that sought to deny such intimacy legal recognition. Lin introduces readers to an unlikely cast of historical figures—from activists and artists to ordinary people who became extraordinary through their refusal to remain invisible.

Blending sharp wit with genuine emotion, the book examines how love persists despite institutional hostility. It asks fundamental questions about who gets to define legitimate relationships and what it means to build a life together when society refuses to acknowledge your right to exist.","When Congress threatens to tear apart same-sex couples with the Defense of Marriage Act, two lovers go underground in 1990s San Francisco. Atherton Lin weaves their outlaw romance through a kaleidoscopic history of queer resistance and desire.",416,,Biography & Autobiography / LGBTQ+,"Little, Brown and Company",03/06/2025,Jeremy Atherton Lin,"Jeremy Atherton Lin wrote Gay Bar, which earned recognition as a New York Times Top Book of 2021 and received the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Atherton Lin has contributed book reviews to the Guardian and the Washington Post, while his audio work has been featured on NTS Radio. He divides his time between Los Angeles and East Sussex, England.","""Deep House goes from the pensoroso of the best history of marriage equality we have to the allegro of a very hot gay love story told in the funniest, most tender way.""

—Edmund White

""A strong cocktail of memoir, legal history and sociology...Atherton Lin beautifully captures the Bay Area at the turn of the millennium: the creeping gentrification, the tech bros, the video shops, the aging hippies. He's also not shy in his descriptions of sex of many kinds and configurations, with all the attendant sensations. (At times you can almost smell it.)""

—The Washington Post

""Deep House is that rare and beautiful book—equally illuminating and pleasurable. I loved its luminous transcription of queer life, its incisive and intimate legal history of gay marriage in the U.S., its transcendently sexy and propulsive love story, and its portrait of social change that promises not the fantasy of permanent liberty, but that more ephemeral reward: joy. It is exactly the book we need right now.""

9780374228347,Outline,,"During a sweltering Athens summer, a novelist finds herself teaching creative writing while navigating a series of encounters that blur the boundaries between listener and storyteller. From airplane conversations with strangers to dinners with fellow writers, she becomes a repository for other people's confessions—their failed relationships, creative ambitions, and personal mythologies.

Each interaction reveals how people construct narratives about themselves, often as much fiction as truth. Students share their work, acquaintances divulge intimate details over meals, and a chance swimming companion opens up about his life. Through their revelations, questions emerge about what drives us to share our stories and whether we can ever truly know ourselves or others.

The narrator remains deliberately in shadow, her own struggles glimpsed only through absence and silence. This creates a fascinating tension between what is spoken and what remains hidden, between the stories we tell and the truths we cannot face. The result is an examination of how we use narrative to both reveal and conceal ourselves.","A writer travels to Athens to teach a writing course. Instead of telling her own story, she listens as others reveal theirs. Spare yet layered, Outline is a meditation on identity, perception, and the act of storytelling.",256,Outline Trilogy,Fiction / Literary,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",13/01/2015,Rachel Cusk,"Rachel Cusk has written Second Place, the Outline trilogy, and the memoirs A Life's Work and Aftermath, along with numerous other fiction and nonfiction works. A Guggenheim Fellow, she currently makes her home in Paris.","""Rachel Cusk's Outline is full of baking light and quiet melancholy and bodies brushing past one another in the heat; it's a subtle and utterly engrossing exploration of the ways we make ourselves known to one another--in stories and anecdotes, through seductions and disputes--and yet remain opaque; how we sketch ourselves as outlines and find these outlines interrogated. Its conversations echo each other deftly, their acute insights gracefully pulling apart the seams of its carefully composed characters to show glimpses of much messier selves within: a series of searing psychic X-rays bleached by coastal light.""

—Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams

""Like the Higgs boson, which appears only when bombarded by electrons, Rachel Cusk's nearly nameless narrator flickers into visibility only through her encounters with a series of amazingly eloquent and fascinating interlocutors. Writing at the highest level and with the greatest technical restraint, Cusk manages to describe the painful realities of women's lives by a process of erasure that is itself responsible for that suffering. This is a novel where form and content meld so perfectly as to collapse into each other. I am so much the better for having read it. As if someone finally told me the truth by telling me everything, and nothing.""

—Jeffrey Eugenides, author of The Marriage Plot

""Outline, in the most seemingly effortless way imaginable, winds up being completely captivating: the conversations are autobiographies in miniature, with all the holes, lies and self-deceptions lurking in that wily form . . . As you'd expect in a novel so obsessed with language, Cusk's own writing is a pleasure to read -- unfailingly precise and surprising . . . The ultimate and undeniably cerebral pleasure of Outline is it nudges you into being a more attentive reader and listener, more alert to the cracks in sentences and the messier realities that words can only try to contain.""

9780385350815,Dept. of Speculation,,"Marriage becomes a laboratory for examining how love transforms under pressure in this innovative novel told through fragments and observations. The unnamed narrator traces the evolution of her relationship from romantic idealism to the harsh realities of parenthood and betrayal. What begins as playful correspondence between lovers gradually shifts into something more complicated as everyday struggles test their bond.

Offill constructs her story through a mosaic of moments—philosophical reflections, literary references, and stark domestic scenes that reveal how identity fractures and reforms within the confines of family life. The narrative voice shifts between ""the wife"" and ""I,"" marking the protagonist's psychological journey as she grapples with lost artistic ambitions and the all-consuming nature of motherhood.

This is fiction that reads like poetry, where each carefully chosen detail carries emotional weight. The book examines how we make sense of disappointment, how we rebuild after betrayal, and whether it's possible to reconcile the person we once were with who we've become. Through its fragmented structure, the novel mirrors the way memory actually works—in flashes, associations, and sudden moments of clarity.",Fragments of a marriage unraveling and rebuilding under the weight of betrayal and parenthood.

""Absorbing and highly readable . . . Offill has successfully met the challenge she seems to have given herself: write only what needs to be written, and nothing more. No excess, no flab. And do it in a series of bulletins, fortune-cookie commentary, mordant observations, lyrical phrasing.

9781524748173,Constructing a Nervous System,A Memoir,"Memory becomes performance art in this groundbreaking work that defies every convention of autobiographical writing. Rather than following a linear narrative, the text operates like a jazz composition—improvised, layered, and deeply rhythmic. Cultural icons serve as mirrors for self-examination: legendary musicians become conversation partners, literary figures transform into psychological landscapes, and athletic grace provides a vocabulary for understanding Black womanhood.

The author constructs identity through collision and synthesis, allowing disparate influences to speak through her voice. Family history intersects with American cultural mythology, creating a mosaic that reveals how we absorb and reimagine the figures who captivate us. This experimental approach to life writing questions the boundaries between criticism and confession, between individual experience and collective memory.

What emerges is both intimate revelation and cultural excavation—a meditation on how art shapes consciousness and how personal narrative can illuminate broader truths about American identity. The result challenges readers to reconsider what memoir can accomplish when freed from traditional constraints.","Jefferson fragments herself on the page, weaving cultural criticism with personal history in a memoir unlike any other.

Abdurraqib dissects moments both grand and ordinary—a vocalist's raw scream in a Rolling Stones track, childhood playground conflicts, marathon dancing, the tension before a card game begins—revealing how each contains multitudes of meaning that ripple through racial dynamics, political landscapes, and personal memory.

The author moves fluidly between icons like Michael Jackson and Patti LaBelle and intimate domestic scenes, finding equal weight in stadium performances and living room gatherings. His analysis captures both the ecstasy and anguish embedded in Black creative expression, examining how artistry becomes both liberation and burden. These essays traverse geography and decades, connecting midcentury European stages to lunar expeditions to cramped Midwestern apartments, mapping how Black performance shapes and reshapes American identity while often extracting a profound personal cost from its creators.","Cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib examines Black performance across decades of American culture, from Merry Clayton's vocals in ""Gimme Shelter"" to neighborhood spades games.

At its center lies Eliza Touchet, a sharp-witted Scottish woman who manages the household of her declining novelist cousin while harboring deep doubts about the literary world's pretensions and England's social hypocrisies.

Meanwhile, Andrew Bogle carries the weight of his past as an enslaved person on a Jamaican sugar plantation. His hard-won understanding of power dynamics and human nature becomes crucial when he arrives in London to testify in one of the era's most sensational legal battles.

The notorious Tichborne case grips the nation: can a working-class Australian butcher truly be the lost heir to an aristocratic fortune? As testimony unfolds and society takes sides, both Eliza and Andrew must navigate a labyrinth of competing narratives and hidden motives.

Smith constructs a meditation on authenticity itself—who deserves belief, whose stories matter, and how personal truth intersects with historical record. The novel interrogates the very foundations of identity while exposing the economic and social structures that determine whose voice carries weight in the corridors of power.","Set against the legal trial that divided Victorian England, Smith weaves together the stories of a skeptical Scottish housekeeper and a formerly enslaved Jamaican man navigating questions of truth, authenticity, and who gets to be believed.",464,,Fiction / Literary,Penguin Press,05/09/2023,Zadie Smith,"Zadie Smith has published six novels including White Teeth, The Autograph Man, On Beauty, NW, Swing Time, and The Fraud, alongside the novella The Embassy of Cambodia and short story collection Grand Union.

The Shah of Iran commanded vast military resources and sat atop enormous oil wealth, yet within little more than a year, his entire regime crumbled before a religious uprising that caught both Iranian elites and American intelligence completely off guard.

Scott Anderson reconstructs this stunning political collapse, examining how a ruler became so divorced from his people's reality that he failed to recognize the fury building against him. The book traces the miscalculations and willful ignorance that blinded both the Shah and his American supporters to the revolutionary forces gathering strength throughout Iranian society.

Beyond recounting this dramatic historical moment, Anderson positions the Iranian Revolution as a pivotal event that established patterns still reshaping global politics today. The uprising represented something new: religiously motivated populations overthrowing secular, Western-aligned governments. This template would echo across regions and decades, making the events of 1979 essential for understanding contemporary conflicts between traditional religious movements and modernizing elites.",Scott Anderson chronicles the spectacular collapse of the Shah's Iran and America's catastrophic blindness to the revolution brewing beneath their noses.

—The New York Times

""Anderson succeeds precisely because he eschews structural, quasi-philosophical queries for an energetic account that concerns itself with, as he puts it, 'a few core questions'. . . . As a result of this inquiry, Anderson finds an answer at once simpler, more instructive, and truer than those of many scholars. . . .

Through her distinctive visual storytelling, the narrative captures the stark contrast between the intimate coastal community she left behind and the massive industrial landscape where she now labors. The memoir examines how economic necessity drives people from their roots, forcing them into environments that test their resilience in unexpected ways.

The work interrogates Canada's contradictions—a nation celebrated for progressive ideals and pristine wilderness, yet built on industries that extract both natural resources and human dignity.

The attack leaves Geraldine withdrawn and silent, refusing to reveal what happened or who was responsible. As his family fractures under the weight of trauma, Joe watches his father—a respected tribal judge—grapple with legal complexities that seem designed to prevent justice.

The crime's location becomes crucial: different jurisdictions mean different laws, different investigators, and potentially different outcomes. Tribal sovereignty collides with federal and state authority in ways that could let a perpetrator escape consequences entirely. Unable to stand by while bureaucratic maze-running stalls progress, Joe joins forces with his closest friends to conduct their own investigation.

Their search leads them through both the physical landscape of the reservation and the deeper cultural terrain of Ojibwe tradition and belief.

9781328764522,How To Write An Autobiographical Novel,Essays,"In this collection of essays, a writer examines the interconnected nature of personal experience and artistic creation. The pieces chronicle a journey of self-discovery that spans decades, revealing how the act of writing fiction becomes a lens for understanding one's place in the world.

The author navigates complex questions of identity—as a Korean American, as a gay man, as an artist finding his voice in contemporary America. Through intimate reflections on pivotal moments, from personal loss to national tragedies, these essays demonstrate how literature serves as both refuge and weapon in times of crisis.

The collection reveals the unglamorous reality behind a writing life: the odd jobs that pay the bills, the slow process of crafting a debut novel, the weight of bearing witness to history as it unfolds. Yet throughout, there's an underlying faith in the transformative power of storytelling—both the stories we tell about ourselves and those we share with the world.

What emerges is a meditation on survival and creation, showing how we construct meaning from chaos and find ways to preserve what matters most when everything else seems under siege.","Chee traces his evolution from student to teacher through luminous essays that blend personal narrative with reflections on politics, art, and identity. A moving meditation on creating ourselves through storytelling.",288,,Literary Collections / Essays,Mariner Books,17/04/2018,Alexander Chee,"Alexander Chee wrote the novels Edinburgh, which earned him a Whiting Award, and the national bestseller Queen of the Night.

If he's not already a household name, he needs to be…powerful, powerful essays with powerful, powerful words…""

—Isaac Fitzgerald, NBC

""If writing, too, is a form of drag for Chee, it is also an act of mystic invocation and transference...Chee leavens his heaviest topics—the decimation of the gay community in the late 1980s and early '90s, the repressed memory of sexual abuse that inspired Edinburgh—with charming episodes like his stint as a waiter at William and Pat Buckley's Park Avenue maisonette, a job that prompted a crisis of conscience given Buckley's infamous proposal to brand AIDS patients on their wrists and buttocks...Even at his most mystical, Chee is generous; these pieces are personal, never pedagogical. They bespeak an unguarded sincerity and curiosity. Chee is refreshingly open about his sometimes liberating, sometimes claustrophobic sense of exceptionality...He reminds us that whomever a writer pictures as his audience, he is also writing into absence, standing in testimony for the sake of the dead. Like most of the essays here, 'After Peter' pulses with urgency, one piece from a life in restless motion. It is not necessary to agree that How to Write an Autobiographical Novel is itself a kind of novel in order to appreciate that Chee has written a moving and personal tribute to impermanence, a wise and transgressive meditation on a life lived both because of and in spite of America, a place where, he writes, you are allowed to speak the truth as long as nothing changes.""

""Two-thirds of the way through Alexander Chee's How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, I abandoned my sharpened reviewer's pencil in favor of luxuriating in the words. Chee's writing has a mesmerizing quality; his sentences are rife with profound truths without lapsing into the didactic...Chee is a very special artist; his writing is lyrical and accessible, whimsical and sad, often all at the same time. No doubt he is an inspiring writing teacher as well. His views on writing reflect his own, thoughtfully examined life.""

Through his collaboration with a master French clockmaker, Abbas discovers new worlds of knowledge and possibility, including an unexpected connection that draws him toward Europe.

Yet history has other plans. Colonial forces shatter the palace walls, scattering its treasures across distant lands. The magnificent creation Abbas helped bring to life disappears into the hands of those who claim ownership through conquest rather than creation. What begins as artistic apprenticeship evolves into something far more personal—a pursuit that challenges everything Abbas understands about belonging, justice, and the true meaning of home. His journey becomes a meditation on what we lose when empires rise and fall, and what we're willing to sacrifice to restore what was taken.","When teenage woodcarver Abbas creates a mechanical tiger for an Indian sultan, he never imagines it will lead him across continents on a daring mission to reclaim stolen art from colonial plunderers.",304,,Fiction / Literary,Knopf,13/06/2023,Tania James,"Tania James has written the novels Atlas of Unknowns and The Tusk That Did the Damage, along with the story collection Aerogrammes.

Johnson reconstructs a civilization that existed long before European contact, bringing to life the sophisticated maritime culture of the Tu'i Tonga Empire. Through Korero's odyssey, readers encounter a society built on complex hierarchies and oceanic mastery, where navigators read stars like maps and outrigger canoes serve as vessels of both commerce and conquest.

The novel examines how communities respond to environmental crisis and resource scarcity, questioning what individuals owe to their heritage and what sacrifices are worth making for collective survival. Johnson draws from Polynesian oral traditions to create a narrative that feels both historically grounded and mythically resonant, offering insights into how stories themselves become tools of cultural preservation and resistance.","Set in the Polynesian islands during the Tu'i Tonga Empire, this epic follows Korero, a young girl who must undertake a perilous seafaring journey to save her starving people.

What begins as intimate gatherings in a Berlin apartment transforms into an elaborate network of spies, saboteurs, and revolutionaries operating in the shadow of Nazi terror.

Mildred Harnack's journey from Milwaukee graduate student to underground leader unfolds against the backdrop of Hitler's rise to absolute power. She orchestrates daring missions to save Jewish lives, coordinates acts of sabotage against the Reich, and establishes covert channels to feed crucial intelligence to Allied forces. Her network grows from a handful of idealistic activists into Berlin's most significant resistance operation, with members risking everything to distribute anti-Nazi propaganda throughout the city.

The revelation launches her into a complex journey between two competing fears—the chaos of untreated mental illness and the possibility that medication might silence her artistic voice forever.

Forney turns her investigative eye toward the enduring myth that creativity and madness are inseparable partners. Through research and personal reflection, she examines the lives of artists like van Gogh and Plath, questioning whether suffering truly fuels great art or if this belief simply romanticizes genuine pain.

Using her signature black-and-white illustrations, Forney documents the reality of living with a mood disorder—the medical appointments, medication trials, and ongoing negotiation between wellness and creative expression. Her memoir refuses easy answers, instead offering an honest examination of what it means to seek balance when your brain chemistry resists stability.

Her mission seems simple: rescue a white bird named Ama before it's too late. But as the blizzard intensifies and darkness closes in, what begins as an act of compassion transforms into something far more complex and terrifying.

Han Kang crafts a narrative that moves between the tangible world of ice and wind and the shadowy realm where memory and reality converge. The story excavates painful truths about Korea's suppressed past, giving voice to experiences long silenced by official histories. Through the lens of two women's deep bond, the novel examines how violence echoes across generations and how friendship can become both sanctuary and burden.

This is literature that operates on multiple levels—a survival story, a ghost tale, and a meditation on the weight of remembering what others would prefer to forget. Han Kang demonstrates how the most intimate human connections can become vessels for understanding broader historical trauma, creating a work that honors both individual relationships and collective memory.","Through a harrowing winter journey to save a friend's beloved bird, Han Kang weaves a haunting meditation on friendship, memory, and Korea's buried history.",272,,Fiction / Literary,Hogarth,21/01/2025,Han Kang,"Born in South Korea in 1970, Han Kang has established herself as one of contemporary literature's most distinctive voices.

Charles Graeber's investigation into this medical nightmare reveals how bureaucratic indifference and institutional self-protection created the perfect environment for unprecedented harm.

The story centers on a web of relationships that made detection nearly impossible—colleagues who considered the perpetrator a friend, administrators who prioritized public image over patient welfare, and a healthcare system designed to protect itself rather than those it serves. Through extensive interviews and documentary evidence, including recorded conversations with the killer himself, Graeber reconstructs both the crimes and the institutional failures that enabled them.

The narrative transforms from horror story to procedural thriller as investigators and healthcare workers begin to piece together the pattern. At its core lies a moral reckoning: the choice between personal loyalty and professional duty, between institutional silence and public safety.

Lorde saw geology, weather patterns, and living ecosystems as literal teachers for navigating existence as a Black feminist lesbian warrior poet. Her concept of survival extended beyond personal resilience to encompass our collective relationship with a changing planet.

This groundbreaking biography refuses traditional chronological structure, instead moving through Lorde's life like natural forces themselves—cyclical, interconnected, eternal.

The tragedy illuminates the interconnected stories of Seabrook College's inhabitants: a brilliant but lonely boy obsessed with theoretical physics, a dangerous drug dealer, ambitious faculty members, and a cast of adolescents navigating the treacherous waters between childhood and adulthood.

Murray weaves together multiple perspectives to create a kaleidoscopic view of modern education, where academic pressure, social hierarchies, and personal demons collide. The novel moves between comedy and heartbreak as it reveals how seemingly disparate lives—students struggling with identity, teachers grappling with their own failures, administrators pursuing misguided reforms—intersect in unexpected ways.

Beneath its darkly humorous surface, this sprawling narrative interrogates what happens when institutions fail the young people they're meant to protect. Murray captures the absurdity and genuine pain of adolescence while building toward revelations that reframe everything we thought we understood about the central tragedy.","When Skippy dies in a Dublin doughnut shop, his death unravels the lives of students and teachers at an elite Irish boarding school.

This catastrophe marked a brutal end to America's space-age optimism and exposed fatal flaws in the shuttle program.

Adam Higginbotham reconstructs the events through exhaustive research, tracing the personal journeys of the doomed astronauts while revealing the institutional failures that sealed their fate. The narrative exposes how engineers' safety concerns were systematically dismissed, how budget pressures overrode caution, and how organizational dysfunction created a culture where disaster became inevitable.

Beyond the technical breakdown, this account illuminates the human cost of bureaucratic hubris. Higginbotham chronicles the dedicated test pilots, visionary designers, and committed crew members who believed in the mission, even as warning signs accumulated around them.

In Higginbotham's deft hands, the human element—sometimes heroic, sometimes cloaked in doublespeak and bluster—shines through the many technical aspects of this story, a constant reminder that every decision was made by people weighing risks versus expediency, their minds distorted by power, money, politics, and yes-men.

9781668030707,The Slip,,"A boxing gym in late '90s Austin becomes the crossroads where multiple lives intersect in unexpected ways. Nathaniel Rothstein discovers confidence and purpose within the gym's walls, guided by an enigmatic former fighter, only to mysteriously disappear one summer night. Meanwhile, Charles Rex navigates his own search for belonging and connection in a world that offers little of either.

Years pass before Nathaniel's uncle receives information that reignites hope and launches a investigation into what really happened. The search pulls together an unlikely constellation of characters—struggling twins, an ambitious young police officer, and Alexis Cepeda, a talented boxer whose journey to America involved assuming someone else's identity.

Schaefer constructs a sprawling narrative that examines how people reinvent themselves when circumstances demand it. The novel questions what we're willing to sacrifice for acceptance, and whether true transformation comes from changing who we are or finally embracing it. Set against Austin's evolving landscape, these intersecting stories build toward revelations that illuminate the complex ways our lives shape and are shaped by the communities we choose.","In 1998 Austin, a teenage boy finds himself through boxing, then disappears without a trace.

As his family struggles to survive in the ghetto's crushing conditions, Aron becomes part of a dangerous network of children who slip through cracks in the quarantine walls, smuggling food and goods to keep their loved ones alive. Each day brings new threats—corrupt officials, informants, and the ever-present terror of Nazi patrols.

After losing his family, Aron finds sanctuary with Janusz Korczak, the renowned pediatrician and children's advocate who continues his work even as the ghetto closes around them. In Korczak's orphanage, Aron discovers moments of unexpected humanity amid the horror, but the shadow of deportation grows longer each day.

Shepard captures the Holocaust through the eyes of a child who refuses to surrender his voice, even in history's darkest hour.

This balding, health-conscious hypochondriac works in the immortality business, yet faces his own mortality daily. His life takes an unexpected turn through Eunice Park, a sharp-tongued college graduate whose youth and cruelty both attract and devastate him.

Their unlikely romance unfolds against escalating national chaos—economic meltdown, street violence, and foreign intervention threaten to end American civilization entirely. Shteyngart crafts a biting commentary on digital-age relationships and cultural decay, examining how human connection survives when society itself becomes disposable. Through Lenny's desperate attempts to preserve both love and country, the novel questions what remains essentially human in an increasingly dehumanized world.

This satirical vision feels uncomfortably prophetic, blending dark humor with genuine pathos as characters navigate technological alienation and political collapse.

9781594633799,The Invisible Kingdom,Reimagining Chronic Illness,"Millions of Americans battle conditions that medical science struggles to categorize or treat effectively—from autoimmune disorders to post-treatment Lyme disease to long COVID. These ailments share a troubling characteristic: they remain largely invisible to a healthcare system built around clear diagnoses and straightforward treatments.

Meghan O'Rourke examines how our medical framework fails those whose symptoms defy conventional understanding. Her investigation reveals troubling patterns in who gets dismissed—women, working-class patients, and communities of color face particular skepticism when presenting with complex, hard-to-pin-down health problems.

Combining personal narrative with rigorous research, O'Rourke spent years interviewing medical professionals, researchers, and fellow patients to understand why certain illnesses exist in medicine's blind spots. Her analysis challenges fundamental assumptions about what constitutes legitimate disease and questions why conditions without simple explanations are so often met with doubt rather than curiosity.

The result is both an urgent call for medical reform and a compassionate guide for anyone navigating the frustrating terrain of chronic illness. O'Rourke's work illuminates not just individual suffering, but systemic failures that demand a complete rethinking of how we understand bodies, symptoms, and healing.","O'Rourke combines memoir, medical investigation, and cultural criticism to expose how millions suffer from misunderstood chronic illnesses.

What starts as a food lover's pilgrimage quickly transforms into something far more complex. The village of Guzman harbors secrets that run much deeper than ancient cheesemaking traditions, and its charismatic creator, Ambrosio, proves to be a figure of contradictions—brilliant yet broken, magnetic yet mysterious.

As Paterniti delves deeper into village life, he finds himself entangled in a web of hidden truths and long-buried revelations.

Two decades ago, a split-second decision during a violent confrontation forever altered his trajectory and set in motion ripple effects he never anticipated.

Straight constructs a sprawling narrative that follows these reverberations as they touch the lives of Californians struggling to find their place in a land that promises much but delivers unevenly. The novel examines how individual moments of crisis can bind strangers together across time and geography, creating unexpected bonds between people who might otherwise remain invisible to one another.

Through interconnected stories, the book interrogates questions of belonging, survival, and identity in contemporary California. Straight illuminates the experiences of those who call the state home not by choice or opportunity, but through generations of rootedness—people whose stories rarely surface in popular narratives about the Golden State. The result is a multifaceted exploration of what it means to endure and persist in a place where the promise of reinvention often overshadows the reality of those who have nowhere else to go.","Johnny Frias carries California's Indigenous and Spanish heritage in his blood, but a violent encounter from his past as a highway patrol officer ignites unexpected connections across communities.

This expedition strips away any romantic notions of the continent, revealing instead a landscape marked by economic struggle and colonial wounds that refuse to heal.

Theroux's path leads him through encounters that range from profound to absurd—conversations with locals who share their stories of survival, observations of well-meaning but often misguided development efforts, and moments of stark beauty amid overwhelming hardship. His writing balances admiration for Africa's resilience with unflinching criticism of its failures, while simultaneously questioning his own role as an outsider bearing witness.

The book operates on two levels: a geographic expedition across diverse terrains and cultures, and a more personal meditation on aging, purpose, and the ethics of observation. Theroux refuses to offer simple solutions or sentimental conclusions, instead presenting a complex portrait of both the places he visits and his own evolving understanding of what it means to truly see a place versus merely passing through it.","Theroux's final African odyssey takes him from Cape Town to Angola's remote reaches.

Hanif Abdurraqib uses this backdrop to craft a deeply personal meditation on ambition, community, and the stories we tell ourselves about success.

Blending memoir with cultural criticism, Abdurraqib examines the mythology surrounding athletic greatness and the quieter narratives of those who don't make it to the spotlight. His reflections move seamlessly between the hardwood and family dynamics, exploring absent fathers, present mentors, and the weight of expectations that shape young lives.

This isn't simply a book about basketball—it's an investigation into how sports become vessels for our deepest hopes and fears.

This extraordinary novel peels back the layers of friendship, revealing how intimacy can both heal and wound. Jude's history emerges gradually, painting a portrait of survival that challenges everything his friends thought they knew about resilience and love. The story moves through time like a slow revelation, showing how the families we choose can become more vital than the ones we inherit.

Most accounts reduce these complex operations to simple narratives of criminality, missing the human complexity beneath.

Anthropologist Jason De León spent seven years gaining access to this hidden ecosystem, documenting the lives of those who guide migrants through Mexico's dangerous terrain. His research reveals a world populated not by the stereotypical villains of popular imagination, but by individuals navigating impossible circumstances—foot soldiers entering a treacherous trade, conflicted leaders managing desperate crews, and seasoned guides grappling with moral ambiguity.

At the center of this ethnographic investigation is one smuggler's attempt to escape the life that has defined him, complicated by unexpected love and the weight of past choices. De León's immersive approach transforms abstract policy debates into deeply personal stories, illuminating how global economic forces and border enforcement create the conditions that sustain this billion-dollar shadow economy. The result challenges readers to reconsider everything they think they know about migration, survival, and the human cost of fortress-like borders.","Seven years embedded with human smugglers across Mexico yields this unprecedented look at the clandestine world of migration.

By day, he absorbs physics lessons that convince him the universe faces imminent collapse—a revelation so urgent he begins writing desperate letters to Angela Merkel. By night, he works for a local extremist leader whose obsession with Bach has turned violent after someone begins vandalizing the composer's monuments with wolf imagery.

Florian finds himself trapped between his employer's escalating hunt for the mysterious vandal and his own growing certainty that physical reality itself is unraveling. As actual wolves appear in the surrounding countryside, the boundary between Florian's apocalyptic fears and the town's simmering tensions begins to dissolve.

Krasznahorkai constructs this tale as a single, breathless sentence that mirrors the relentless momentum of particles in motion. The result is a darkly comic meditation on extremism, environmental crisis, and the peculiar helplessness of watching civilization fray at its edges.

As medical bills mount and Gloria's condition deteriorates, Corey finds himself thrust into an adult role he never wanted. The situation becomes more complicated when his absent father Leonard suddenly resurfaces, bringing with him a magnetic personality that masks deeper character flaws. While Leonard presents himself as a solution to their problems, Corey begins to see through the carefully constructed facade.

Caught between his desperate love for his dying mother and his growing awareness of his father's manipulative nature, Corey faces impossible choices.

This memoir traces the contours of grief through a mother's relentless self-examination, as Didion scrutinizes every moment, every decision, searching for answers that may not exist.

Moving between past and present, the narrative shifts from Quintana's wedding day to fragments of childhood in California, each memory both precious and painful. Didion dissects her own maternal instincts with characteristic precision, questioning whether love alone was sufficient, whether warning signs went unheeded. The very act of remembering becomes both sanctuary and torment.

Simultaneously, Didion grapples with her own mortality and physical decline—a parallel loss that amplifies the central tragedy. The blue nights of the title represent those luminous summer hours that promise endless light while quietly announcing its inevitable end. This meditation on parenthood, aging, and survival strips away all pretense, leaving only the raw truth of what it means to continue living when the natural order has been shattered.","Didion's devastating meditation on losing her daughter Quintana weaves together memory, aging, and the impossible questions of parenthood.

This deeply human examination reveals how combat trauma ripples through entire families and communities, affecting not only the soldiers themselves but their spouses, children, and the medical professionals working to help them heal.

Finkel spent years tracking members of the 2-16 Infantry Battalion as they navigated the treacherous terrain of civilian life. Their struggles with PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and suicidal thoughts unfold alongside the daily realities of marriage strain, parenting challenges, and the search for purpose beyond military service. The book illuminates a fundamental disconnect: society's gratitude for military service often masks a profound misunderstanding of what that service actually costs.

Through meticulous reporting and compassionate storytelling, Finkel exposes the inadequacy of support systems meant to help veterans transition home.

The parents document everything—conversations, landscapes, radio broadcasts about migrant children lost at the border. Their destination lies in Apache territory, chosen because, as the father explains, the Apache represented the end of an era.

The children create their own narratives during the long drive, transforming the adult world's complexities into games and stories they can navigate. Meanwhile, the marriage quietly fractures, each mile revealing deeper incompatibilities between the parents' worldviews.

This innovative novel operates as both intimate family portrait and urgent meditation on displacement. Through inventive storytelling techniques that incorporate photographs, lists, and multiple narrative voices, the book examines how we construct meaning from chaos.

What begins as an unexpected connection between two teenagers facing terminal illness becomes something neither of them anticipated: a love story that refuses to be diminished by circumstance.

John Green crafts a narrative that sidesteps easy comfort and cheap sentiment. Instead, he finds authentic moments of joy and connection amid the reality of living with serious illness. The story examines how we create meaning when time feels limited, how love can flourish even in the shadow of loss, and how humor becomes a form of resistance against despair.

This isn't a story that asks readers to find silver linings or believe that everything happens for a reason.

Eve finds herself responsible for protecting her younger brother, who carries with him a children's Bible that seems to predict the unfolding disasters around them.

Millet constructs a story that functions on multiple levels—a coming-of-age tale, an environmental thriller, and a meditation on how one generation's mistakes become the next generation's inheritance.

The document claims to chronicle the secret activities of the Korean Provisional Government—not as the symbolic exile organization from 1919 textbooks, but as a clandestine force that never disbanded, quietly orchestrating efforts toward Korean reunification across decades.

This discovery launches readers into a dizzying alternate reality where historical figures like Syngman Rhee rub shoulders with Jack London and Marilyn Monroe, all supposedly connected to this shadow organization. Park constructs an elaborate conspiracy that threads through American pop culture touchstones—from M*A*S*H to the Moonies—while linking seemingly unrelated events like presidential assassinations and Cold War aviation disasters.

Through multiple narrative perspectives and enigmatic archival materials, Park creates a literary hall of mirrors where Korean and American histories reflect and refract each other in unexpected ways. The result is both a rollicking entertainment and a meditation on how marginalized stories get erased, asking whether the impossible dreams of diaspora communities might be more real than official records suggest.","A kaleidoscopic alternate history imagining a secret Korean government still operating today.

This meditation on love and loss refuses conventional narratives about healing or moving forward. Instead, Li inhabits a different understanding of time, where past and present collapse into an eternal now. She finds sustenance in daily practices: tending her garden, studying philosophy, learning piano. These acts become forms of devotion, ways of living thoughtfully in death's shadow.

Rather than a chronicle of mourning, this becomes an exploration of how consciousness endures catastrophe.

9780393242133,Is a River Alive?,,"What if we viewed rivers not as resources to exploit, but as sentient entities deserving protection under law? This question drives Macfarlane through landscapes both pristine and scarred, from Ecuador's mist-shrouded highlands to India's contaminated waterways to Canada's threatened wilderness corridors.

Each destination reveals different threats—extractive industries, industrial waste, massive infrastructure projects—yet also different movements to grant rivers personhood status. Threading through these global expeditions runs a more intimate narrative: Macfarlane's relationship with a small chalk stream near his home, whose seasonal rhythms mirror his own contemplations about humanity's place within natural systems.

This isn't simply environmental advocacy disguised as travel literature. Macfarlane weaves together indigenous wisdom, legal philosophy, and scientific understanding to examine how language shapes our relationship with the non-human world. His writing moves fluidly between the microscopic and the vast, finding wonder in both a mayfly's emergence and a glacier's retreat. The result challenges readers to reconsider fundamental assumptions about consciousness, rights, and our interconnected fate with the waterways that sustain all life.","Three journeys across Ecuador, India, and Canada explore whether rivers should be considered living beings with legal rights.

9780593318737,Wayward,,"At fifty-two, Samantha Raymond makes a decision that shocks everyone around her: she purchases a deteriorating house in a struggling Syracuse neighborhood and walks away from her comfortable suburban world. Her choice emerges from sleepless nights spent wrestling with questions about identity, purpose, and belonging in an America that feels increasingly fractured.

As Samantha settles into her new reality, she must confront the relationships she's left behind—a sick mother who needs her, a teenage daughter pulling away, and a marriage she's chosen to abandon. Her physical relocation becomes an emotional excavation, forcing her to examine what she truly wants from the years ahead.

Spiotta creates a character study that refuses easy answers about middle age, family obligations, or personal fulfillment. The novel interrogates how women navigate the tension between duty and desire, asking whether it's possible to remake yourself when you're already decades into adulthood. Through Samantha's story, readers encounter both the liberation and consequences of choosing an unconventional path.","When fifty-two-year-old Samantha Raymond impulsively buys a crumbling house in Syracuse, she abandons suburban life to navigate midlife reckonings.

9781982135164,Joyride,A Memoir,"Susan Orlean opens her memoir with a simple truth: her existence has been shaped by the narratives she's pursued. This intimate chronicle traces how a restless curiosity led her from profiling an ordinary ten-year-old to documenting a tiger enthusiast's unusual passion, from capturing weekend rituals to ascending Japan's sacred mountain.

Beyond the adventures, Orlean dissects the craft itself—how ideas spark to life, how deadlines loom and pass, how strangers become willing subjects, and how the right opening sentence can unlock an entire piece. She maps the territory between inspiration and execution with the precision of someone who has navigated it for decades.

Yet this memoir ventures into more vulnerable terrain than her previous work. Orlean examines the intersection of professional ambition and personal upheaval: establishing herself in journalism while her marriage dissolved, discovering love anew, embracing motherhood as her own mother faded, and grappling with life's finite nature. The book also serves as a portal to journalism's shifting landscape, from the vibrant alternative press to collaborating with editorial legends who shaped modern magazine culture.","Susan Orlean's most personal book yet—a luminous memoir about building a creative life.

9780062977397,Black in Blues,How a Color Tells the Story of My People,"The color blue threads through Black experience in ways both profound and unexpected. Imani Perry embarks on an intimate investigation of this connection, revealing how blue has shaped cultural memory, artistic expression, and spiritual understanding across centuries.

From the indigo plantations that fueled the slave trade to the musical traditions that transformed American sound, Perry uncovers blue's dual nature as both sanctuary and sorrow. She examines how this single hue carries the weight of historical trauma while simultaneously offering transcendence—appearing in everything from the protective blue bottles of Southern folklore to the revolutionary aesthetics of contemporary art.

Perry's meditation moves fluidly between personal memory and collective history, between the blue flowers she tends in remembrance and the blue-black skin that has been both celebrated and demonized. Her analysis reveals blue as a form of resistance and recognition, a way of claiming beauty in the face of violence.

This is cultural criticism as spiritual practice, where color becomes a lens for understanding identity, creativity, and survival. Perry demonstrates how Blue and Blackness create their own geography of meaning, one that spans continents and generations while remaining deeply rooted in the particular experiences of Black life.","National Book Award winner Imani Perry explores the profound connections between the color blue and Black history, weaving together personal reflection, cultural analysis, and historical insight in luminous prose.",256,,History / African American & Black,Ecco,28/01/2025,Imani Perry,"Imani Perry received the National Book Award for South to America and has published seven additional works of nonfiction.

Rosie never came. Frank left alone, convinced she'd gotten cold feet about his troubled family, and built himself a new identity as a detective. The old neighborhood became a closed chapter—until a construction crew discovers Rosie's long-lost suitcase hidden in a crumbling house.

Suddenly Frank faces an impossible investigation. His colleagues don't want him anywhere near the case, fearing his emotional investment will compromise their work.

Whether he's watching a relationship crumble during a Caribbean vacation, contemplating infidelity in mundane domestic moments, or trying to connect with his son through simple gestures, Yunior embodies the contradictions of a man caught between cultures and his own destructive impulses.

Díaz crafts a portrait of masculinity that refuses easy answers, examining how heritage, desire, and self-sabotage intersect in the life of a Dominican American man who can't seem to learn from his mistakes. These interconnected stories pulse with the rhythm of contemporary immigrant life, where love affairs unfold against backdrops of laundromats and baseball diamonds, and where the cost of belonging—to a culture, to another person—is measured in the relationships left behind.

The result is an unflinching examination of romantic failure that finds humor and humanity in even the most damaging choices, suggesting that our capacity for love might be inseparable from our talent for destroying it.","Díaz charts the romantic misadventures of Yunior, a Dominican American man whose infidelity and longing expose the messy realities of love and masculinity.

The narrative spans from the audacious Normandy landings through Germany's ultimate collapse, revealing how a series of desperate gambles and costly victories finally broke the Third Reich.

Drawing on extensive archival research, Atkinson weaves together voices from across the military hierarchy—from high command strategists to frontline soldiers facing their first combat. The book illuminates major operations including the bloody Normandy breakout, the failed airborne assault at Arnhem, and Hitler's last-ditch offensive in the Ardennes, showing how each campaign shaped the war's trajectory.

Carrie Brownstein's story unfolds against the backdrop of the Pacific Northwest's explosive music scene, where she transforms from devoted fan to pioneering artist.

The formation of Sleater-Kinney marks a turning point—not just in Brownstein's life, but in rock history itself. The band emerges as a defining force in feminist punk, challenging conventions and earning critical acclaim that would cement their legacy. Yet beneath the success lies a deeper narrative about finding voice, purpose, and community through art.

Brownstein examines how music offered escape from personal turmoil while simultaneously demanding vulnerability and authenticity. Her account reveals the contradictions inherent in underground culture—the fierce independence alongside desperate need for connection, the rejection of mainstream values while craving recognition. These tensions mirror her own internal struggles with identity and belonging.

George Hodgman faces a dilemma many adult children know well: his mother Betty refuses to leave the house she's called home for decades, despite her advancing age and increasing needs.

Betty emerges as a formidable character—sharp-tongued, independent, and carrying decades of unspoken tensions about her son's sexuality. Their daily negotiations reveal layers of family history, from cherished memories to carefully avoided conversations. The house itself becomes a character, filled with remnants of a different era and the lingering presence of George's deceased father.

This isn't simply a story about elder care, but an examination of how families navigate love across generational and cultural divides.

Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II’s African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel’s desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war material. Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war, but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS’s remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in the Africa and then on the Continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow.

Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy. The result is not just a tremendous war story, but a fascinating group portrait of men of whom history and country asked the most.","The incredible untold story of WWII’s greatest secret fighting force, as told by our great modern master of wartime intrigue",400,,History / Wars & Conflicts / World War II,Crown,04/10/2016,Ben Macintyre,"Ben Macintyre is a writer-at-large for The Times (U.K.) and the bestselling author of Agent Sonya, The Spy and the Traitor, A Spy Among Friends, Double Cross, Operation Mincemeat, Agent Zigzag, and Rogue Heroes, among other books.

Yet this memoir reveals how the human spirit adapts and ultimately flourishes.

Their descendants' stories unfold on opposite sides of the ocean, creating a tapestry of interconnected lives shaped by colonialism, war, and survival.

In Ghana, one sister's family line navigates the complexities of tribal conflicts and European influence as communities grapple with their role in human trafficking. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the other sister's progeny endure the brutalities of plantation life, later migrating north through Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, and into contemporary America.

Each generation carries forward both visible and invisible scars, as personal choices ripple through time.

A chance encounter with an eager young producer promises everything Jane needs—a lucrative deal creating content for a major streaming platform. The producer sees dollar signs in Jane's background, envisioning her as the perfect collaborator for what he believes will be groundbreaking television. Jane's academic credentials make her exactly the kind of ""authentic voice"" the industry claims to want.

But Jane soon discovers that Hollywood's version of opportunity comes with strings attached, and the very qualities that made her attractive to the producer may ultimately become her undoing.

This investigation reconstructs both the life that led to that fatal encounter and the institutional failures that made it inevitable.

Garner emerges as a full human being: funny and flawed, devoted to family yet struggling with his own demons, a street-corner entrepreneur trying to survive in a system designed to criminalize his existence. His world intersected tragically with a police force operating under policies that prioritized arrests over public safety, creating the conditions for a preventable death.

Through meticulous reporting, this account exposes how broken incentives, racial bias, and institutional dysfunction converged on a Staten Island sidewalk. The aftermath—a grand jury's refusal to indict, a family's fight for accountability, a nation grappling with uncomfortable truths—reveals the deep fractures in American justice.

Then tragedy strikes, shattering her carefully constructed world and revealing the fragility beneath her sense of invincibility. Stripped of her illusions about personal agency, Levy must rebuild from the ground up, questioning everything she thought she knew about independence and resilience.

This memoir traces not just one woman's reckoning with loss, but captures the broader tensions of contemporary American life—the promises and perils of unlimited choice, the cost of ambition, and the challenge of finding meaning when certainty disappears.

McCurdy's memoir reveals the dark reality behind her Nickelodeon success, tracing how her mother's relentless ambition transformed childhood into a series of calculated performances both on and off camera.

From extreme dieting regimens disguised as health consciousness to invasive control over every aspect of her personal life, McCurdy lived under constant surveillance designed to manufacture the perfect young star. Even as she landed coveted roles on hit shows like iCarly and Sam & Cat, the psychological toll mounted through anxiety, disordered eating, and a complete loss of personal autonomy.

The death of her controlling mother creates an unexpected crisis of identity rather than relief. Without the familiar framework of manipulation and demands, McCurdy must navigate recovery while questioning everything she thought she knew about love, success, and her own desires.

9781594488399,The Interestings,,"At a creative summer camp in 1974, six teenagers forge an unbreakable connection that will define their lives for decades to come. What begins as shared artistic passion and youthful ambition evolves into something far more complex as these friends navigate the realities of adult life in an ever-changing world.

Jules dreams of comedy stardom but finds herself settling for something safer and more mundane. Jonah possesses remarkable musical ability yet abandons his craft entirely. Meanwhile, Ethan and Ash—now married to each other—soar to extraordinary heights, their artistic visions flourishing alongside their bank accounts. The group's bonds remain intact, but the vast disparities in their circumstances create unexpected tensions.

Wolitzer crafts a meditation on the unpredictable nature of success and the corrosive effects of comparison. The novel questions whether raw talent guarantees fulfillment, examines how privilege shapes opportunity, and reveals the subtle ways resentment can infiltrate even our most cherished relationships. Against the backdrop of a transforming New York City, these characters grapple with the gap between adolescent dreams and middle-aged reality, discovering that the most enduring friendships must somehow accommodate both love and envy.","Six teenagers bond at arts camp the summer Nixon resigns, then navigate decades of diverging fortunes.

The narrative follows characters like Amma, a playwright grappling with newfound success and questions of sexuality, and Shirley, an educator exhausted by the challenges of teaching in an underfunded system. Their paths cross with others including Carole, who has climbed the corporate ladder but struggles with her mother Bummi's concerns about cultural disconnection.

The cast ranges from a young nonbinary influencer to an elderly woman living in rural Northern England, each bringing their own perspective to questions of heritage, belonging, and what it means to be Black and British today. Evaristo examines how colonial legacies continue to shape lives while celebrating the resilience and diversity of her characters.

The novel's distinctive style abandons traditional punctuation in favor of flowing, verse-like passages that create a rhythmic, almost musical reading experience.

Sullivan's journey takes him deep into spaces where American identity crystallizes: a Christian music festival, the aftermath of natural disasters, the childhood homes of pop icons. His subjects range from obscure historical figures to contemporary celebrities, yet each encounter illuminates something essential about how myth and reality intertwine in American life.

The author approaches his subjects with equal parts skepticism and affection, revealing the absurdities and genuine pathos that coexist in our cultural moments.

A mother, consumed by loss and seeking escape through substances, disappears into a nightmare she never saw coming—a labor camp disguised as legitimate work, where debt becomes chains and freedom dissolves into fiction.

Miles away, her young son refuses to accept her absence. His childhood becomes a quest, shaped by the hollow space where his mother should be. He carries questions that have no easy answers and hope that defies logic.

James Hannaham constructs this story through an audacious narrative choice: three distinct perspectives that include the very substance that helped destroy one life while ironically becoming a voice in its telling. The result challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths about exploitation that persists in contemporary America.

This isn't simply a story about victimization—it's an examination of resilience, the complexity of human bonds, and the ways people survive systems designed to break them. Hannaham weaves social critique with intimate family drama, creating a work that operates simultaneously as urgent political commentary and deeply personal exploration of what we owe each other, especially those we love most.","When grief drives Darlene to drugs, she vanishes into a world of modern slavery while her young son searches desperately for her.

In this searing memoir, Trethewey excavates the circumstances that led to her mother's death, tracing the threads of racism and domestic violence that created a perfect storm of tragedy. Growing up biracial in the Jim Crow South, both mother and daughter navigated a world hostile to their very existence. Trethewey examines how her mother's choices—born from limited options in a segregated society—ultimately placed them both in danger.

The author's poetic sensibility illuminates every page as she reconstructs not just the crime itself, but the complex woman her mother was: loving, vulnerable, fierce, and trapped. This is both an intimate portrait of grief and a broader indictment of the systems that failed to protect a woman in peril. Trethewey transforms personal devastation into art that speaks to anyone who has loved someone they couldn't save.","When Trethewey was nineteen, her former stepfather murdered her mother in a crime that would define both women's legacies.

The story unfolds across the blood-soaked plains of Troy, where heroes clash in combat that will echo through eternity, yet the real drama lies in quieter moments—a father pleading for his son's body, warriors confronting their own mortality, gods manipulating human fate from their celestial realm.

This version captures both the poem's savage intensity and its profound meditation on honor, loss, and the price of glory. The translation reveals characters who feel startlingly modern in their complexity: Achilles wrestling with rage and grief, Hector torn between duty and family, Helen bearing the weight of a war fought in her name.

His world shifts dramatically after discovering Benjamin Pearl, an eleven-year-old boy surviving in harsh wilderness conditions with his father Jeremiah, a deeply paranoid man preparing for societal collapse.

Through patient work, Pete manages to build a tentative connection with this unusual family. Yet his professional dedication to protecting children stands in stark contrast to his personal failures—particularly his fractured relationship with his own teenage daughter. The situation becomes increasingly complex as federal agents begin investigating Jeremiah's activities, transforming Pete's quiet intervention into something far more dangerous.

Against Montana's unforgiving landscape, the novel examines how America's foundational values—liberty, self-reliance, suspicion of authority—can twist into something destructive. Henderson crafts a story that questions what we owe to each other, especially the most vulnerable among us, while exploring how good intentions can spiral beyond anyone's control.","When a Montana social worker encounters a survivalist and his feral son living off-grid, their fragile trust unravels as FBI attention and personal tragedy collide in devastating ways.",480,,Fiction / Family Life,Ecco,27/05/2014,Smith Henderson,Smith Henderson wrote Fourth of July Creek and divides his time between California and Montana.

Mary Roach investigates this fascinating intersection of desperation and ingenuity, where the limits of human biology meet cutting-edge technology.

The author's investigation spans continents and decades, examining both historical oddities and futuristic possibilities. She witnesses surgeons performing sight-restoring operations in remote locations, observes the meticulous work of tissue recovery specialists during overnight procedures, and explores facilities where researchers cultivate hair follicles using stem cell technology. Her reporting also takes her inside specialized medical environments, from sterile research facilities housing genetically modified pigs to rehabilitation centers housing vintage medical equipment.

Roach tackles the profound ethical and practical dilemmas that emerge as replacement medicine advances. At what point does amputation become preferable to reconstruction? How do we navigate the psychological complexities of receiving organs from other species or laboratory-grown tissues? Through her signature blend of scientific rigor and irreverent humor, she illuminates both the promise and peculiarities of humanity's ongoing effort to transcend biological limitations.","Roach explores medicine's quest to replace failing body parts, from brass noses to 3D-printed organs.

His target: the mysterious North Pole, still shrouded in scientific speculation and romantic theory. Bennett selected Captain George Washington De Long to lead this ambitious quest aboard the USS Jeannette, betting that American ingenuity could conquer the planet's final frontier.

What began as a voyage fueled by national pride and scientific curiosity transformed into an epic test of human endurance. The Arctic Ocean proved far more treacherous than anyone anticipated, trapping the Jeannette in an iron grip of pack ice for nearly two years before crushing the vessel entirely. Suddenly, thirty-two men found themselves stranded on shifting ice floes, hundreds of miles from civilization, with winter closing in and their supplies dwindling.

Their only hope lay in an impossible journey across one of Earth's most hostile environments. This account reveals how ordinary sailors and officers faced extraordinary circumstances, where each decision meant the difference between salvation and death, and where the line between heroism and desperation blurred in the endless white expanse of the polar wilderness.","The true story of the USS Jeannette's doomed 1879 Arctic expedition, when 32 men became trapped in ice and fought for survival across a thousand miles of frozen wasteland.

9780375424090,There But For The,,"What drives someone to stage such a dramatic retreat from the world? Miles Garth's decision to barricade himself in a bedroom during an elegant dinner party becomes the catalyst for an unexpected meditation on isolation and intimacy. Four observers—each connected to Miles by the thinnest of threads—find themselves drawn into the mystery of his self-imposed exile.

Smith constructs her narrative through these four voices: Anna, Mark, May, and young Brooke, none of whom can claim to truly know the man at the center of their fascination. Their varied attempts to decode Miles's motivations reveal as much about their own lives as his, creating a kaleidoscope of perspectives that questions whether genuine understanding between people is ever possible.

The novel transforms a seemingly simple premise into an intricate examination of the spaces between us—both the distances we maintain and the unexpected moments of recognition that can emerge from the most casual encounters. Smith's characteristic linguistic playfulness serves a deeper purpose here, illustrating how language itself can both connect and divide us as we struggle to make sense of each other's inner worlds.","When a man locks himself in a room at a dinner party and refuses to leave, four near-strangers become unlikely witnesses to his breakdown.

9780451493026,Black Is the Body,"Stories from My Grandmother's Time, My Mother's Time, and Mine","Emily Bernard crafts a collection of twelve essays that interrogate the lived reality of race in America through her own intimate lens. Her reflections span from childhood in the South—where she carried a surname passed down from white ancestry—to a life-altering assault at a coffee shop, to building an interracial marriage and family.

Bernard's academic life in Vermont's predominantly white landscape provides another layer of complexity as she raises two Ethiopian children while teaching in spaces where she often stands alone. Her writing refuses easy answers, instead choosing to sit with the uncomfortable tensions that define Black existence in America.

Each piece builds upon the others, creating a mosaic that challenges readers to reconsider how we discuss race beyond tired talking points. Bernard's approach is both scholarly and deeply human, drawing connections between her individual story and the larger American narrative. The result is a work that demands we confront difficult truths about identity, family, and what it costs to move through the world in a Black body.","Twelve interconnected essays explore race, identity, and belonging through Bernard's personal experiences—from growing up Black in the South to raising adopted Ethiopian children in predominantly white New England.",240,,Biography & Autobiography / Memoirs,Knopf,29/01/2019,Emily Bernard,"Emily Bernard grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, before earning her PhD in American studies from Yale University.

9780593653982,Memorial Days,A Memoir,"The sudden death of a beloved spouse shatters more than just a heart—it demolishes the entire architecture of daily existence. For three years after losing her husband Tony Horwitz to an unexpected heart attack, Geraldine Brooks found herself drowning in bureaucratic obligations and social expectations that left no room for the ancient human need to simply sit with sorrow.

Determined to honor both her grief and her marriage, Brooks eventually escapes to an isolated stretch of Australian coastline. There, in deliberate solitude, she begins the work that our hurried world rarely permits: examining how different societies have always understood that mourning requires time, ritual, and space apart from ordinary life.

This memoir moves between tender recollections of a thirty-year partnership built on shared adventures, intellectual companionship, and deep affection, and Brooks's raw confrontation with widowhood. Her retreat becomes both a personal reckoning and a broader meditation on how we might better support ourselves and others through life's most devastating transitions. The result is a book that refuses easy comfort while offering something more valuable: honest witness to both the magnitude of loss and the possibility of carrying love forward.","Brooks retreats to a remote Australian island three years after her husband's sudden death, seeking the space to grieve that modern life denied her.

But Paul operates by an uncompromising moral code that sets him apart from others who navigate life through convenient accommodations. After losing his construction job on a high-end Manhattan project, he pulls over at a highway rest stop to consider his next move. There he witnesses an act of shocking cruelty that demands immediate action.

The choice Paul makes in that moment becomes a catalyst that threatens to destroy the fragile life he's built with Kate and Ruby.

Years pass, and what seemed like ancient history suddenly demands a reckoning.

9780062005595,Kansas City Lightning,The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker,"The saxophone genius who transformed American music deserves more than mythology. Stanley Crouch peels back decades of romanticization to reveal Charlie Parker's formative years—not as the tortured artist of popular imagination, but as a determined young musician navigating the vibrant, dangerous world of 1930s Kansas City.

This biography excavates the human being beneath the legend: a teenager whose musical ambitions collided with personal demons, family pressures, and the harsh realities of Depression-era America. Crouch traces Parker's artistic development through the jazz laboratories of Kansas City's nightclub scene, where he absorbed influences from masters like Lester Young while battling the addiction that would eventually claim his life.

Drawing on extensive research and interviews, Crouch reconstructs Parker's world with novelistic detail—the smoky clubs, the musical rivalries, the complex relationships that shaped both his art and his self-destruction. Rather than mythologizing Parker's genius, this first volume of a planned two-part work examines how extraordinary talent emerged from ordinary circumstances, and how the seeds of both triumph and tragedy were planted in those crucial early years.",Stanley Crouch's long-awaited biography captures Charlie Parker as a young genius coming of age in Depression-era Kansas City.

Dan Fagin masterfully weaves together the threads of this environmental catastrophe, following the brave individuals who refused to accept the status quo. At the center of his narrative are the families devastated by childhood cancer clusters, the healthcare workers who connected alarming dots, and the activists who channeled their anguish into relentless pursuit of accountability.

This investigation spans six decades of industrial malfeasance and governmental inaction, while celebrating the groundbreaking researchers who established crucial connections between environmental toxins and human disease. Fagin transforms dense scientific concepts into accessible storytelling, creating a compelling chronicle of David versus Goliath that resonates far beyond New Jersey's borders.

The text he rescued was Lucretius's *On the Nature of Things*, a radical Roman work proposing that existence unfolds without divine intervention and that reality consists of atoms moving through void.

Stephen Greenblatt chronicles how this philosophical bombshell ignited the Renaissance and continues reverberating today. The poem's atomic theory and rejection of religious dogma found their way into Galileo's telescopes and Darwin's notebooks, while its celebration of pleasure influenced everyone from Montaigne's essays to Jefferson's political vision.

This intellectual detective story reveals how precariously human knowledge hangs by a thread—one manuscript, one curious reader, one moment of recognition that changes everything.

9781451676563,After Visiting Friends,A Son's Story,"The death of a father creates ripples that can last a lifetime. For Michael Hainey, those ripples began at age six with the sudden loss of his newspaper reporter father in 1970s Chicago. Official explanations spoke of a heart attack, but the circumstances surrounding that night remained frustratingly unclear.

Decades later, armed with his own journalistic skills, Hainey embarks on a deeply personal investigation that takes him through Chicago's gritty newspaper culture of the era. His search leads him into a world where loyalty runs deep and secrets are carefully guarded—a place where his father's colleagues maintain their silence even years after his death.

Central to this quest is Hainey's relationship with his mother, a woman whose strength helped hold their fractured family together but whose reluctance to revisit the past creates its own obstacles. As he pieces together fragments of his father's final night, Hainey must navigate between the parent he remembers and the complex individual he's discovering.

This memoir illuminates the gap between the stories families tell themselves and the messier truths that lie beneath. It's both an intimate family reckoning and a vivid snapshot of Chicago's vanishing newspaper world.","When his newspaper reporter father died mysteriously in 1970s Chicago, six-year-old Michael Hainey was left with questions that haunted him for decades.

9780593831878,The Emperor of Gladness,,"In the decaying landscape of East Gladness, Connecticut, two broken souls find salvation in each other. Hai, a nineteen-year-old teetering on the edge of despair, encounters Grazina, an aging woman whose mind drifts between past and present. What begins as an act of desperate necessity—Hai caring for this stranger—evolves into something neither expected: a profound connection that rewrites the meaning of family.

Vuong examines the invisible threads that bind us to one another, particularly those society overlooks or discards. Through the shifting seasons, Hai and Grazina navigate the complexities of dependence, dignity, and the stories we tell ourselves to survive. Their partnership becomes a meditation on what it means to belong somewhere, to someone, when traditional structures have failed.

This novel interrogates the American experience through the lens of those existing in its shadows—immigrants, the elderly, the mentally ill, the economically forgotten. Vuong weaves together questions of identity, trauma, and resilience, creating a narrative that feels both intimate and expansive. The result is a deeply moving exploration of how human connection can emerge from the most unlikely circumstances, offering hope where none seemed possible.","When a suicidal teenager becomes caretaker to an elderly woman with dementia, their unlikely bond transforms both their lives.

Born into Newark's most challenging neighborhoods, he excelled academically while his father served time and his mother worked multiple jobs to make ends meet. His exceptional mind earned him admission to Yale, where he studied complex sciences alongside America's privileged elite.

But academic success couldn't resolve the fundamental tension in Peace's life. He remained tethered to his community, supporting his family through means that contradicted everything his education represented. Jeff Hobbs, Peace's college roommate, constructs an intimate portrait of a young man caught between incompatible worlds—each demanding different versions of himself.

This biography examines the fault lines that define contemporary America: the persistence of racial and economic barriers, the complexity of loyalty, and the sometimes impossible mathematics of social mobility. Peace's story illuminates how exceptional talent can coexist with tragic choices, and how the pull of family and community can override even the most promising opportunities. It's an unflinching look at what happens when individual brilliance collides with systemic limitations.","Jeff Hobbs chronicles his Yale roommate Robert Peace, a brilliant young man from Newark who navigated between two worlds—elite academia and the dangerous streets of home.

Sure, the marriage fell apart, but he's got his hepatology practice, weekend custody arrangements, and a surprisingly active dating life thanks to smartphone apps. Then Rachel, his ex-wife, drops their children off one day and completely disappears.

Suddenly Toby finds himself overwhelmed—managing full-time parenting while maintaining his medical career and wondering where his former spouse has gone. In his mind, the story is straightforward: he's the reasonable one married to a woman whose career ambitions ultimately consumed everything else.

Yet as the mystery of Rachel's whereabouts deepens, cracks begin forming in Toby's version of events. The truth about their relationship—and its spectacular collapse—proves far more complex than his neat explanations suggest. This debut novel dissects contemporary marriage with surgical precision, revealing how two people can live entirely different versions of the same life together, and how the stories we tell ourselves about love, success, and failure rarely capture the whole picture.","When Toby's ex-wife vanishes after dropping off their kids, his carefully constructed post-divorce life crumbles.

9780393069624,Charlie Chan,The Untold Story of the Honorable Detective and His Rendezvous with American History,"A single arrest in 1904 Honolulu would spawn one of America's most enduring and problematic fictional detectives. Chang Apana, a Hawaiian police officer, became the unlikely inspiration for Charlie Chan, but his real story remained buried beneath decades of Hollywood mythology.

Yunte Huang embarks on a detective story of his own, piecing together the life of this forgotten lawman through archives, cemeteries, and family records across two languages and multiple continents. What emerges is far more complex than the Hollywood caricature: a portrait of territorial Hawaii's multicultural tensions, the entertainment industry's racial blind spots, and one man's transformation into a cultural phenomenon.

This investigation reveals how Charlie Chan became both a breakthrough for Asian representation and a source of lasting stereotype. Huang connects Apana's actual police work to the broader American struggle with Asian identity, showing how popular culture can simultaneously celebrate and diminish entire communities. The result is part biography, part cultural archaeology, and part personal reckoning with how stories shape our understanding of race, representation, and the American dream.",The fascinating true story behind Charlie Chan and the Hawaiian cop who inspired him.

Michel Adanson's secret memoir tells of his younger self, consumed by tales of an extraordinary figure known as the revenant—a woman of royal blood who broke free from the slave fortress of Gorée Island and vanished into legend.

Driven by fascination that borders on madness, the young scientist abandons his botanical studies to chase whispers and stories across the Senegalese landscape. His quest leads him through villages where oral histories blur the line between myth and memory, deeper into a world where French colonial brutality collides with ancient traditions and enduring resistance.

The search becomes a reckoning—with the violence of empire, the complexity of desire, and the stories we tell ourselves about love and obsession. Rooted in the storytelling traditions of Senegal, this novel weaves together multiple voices and timelines to create something that feels both historically grounded and mythically resonant. It's a meditation on how legends are born from real suffering and real courage, and how the act of seeking someone can transform the seeker in ways they never anticipated.","When a French botanist dies uttering a mysterious woman's name, his hidden memoir reveals an obsessive search through 18th-century Senegal for an escaped slave known as the revenant.

This elite circle, generations in the making, existed in careful tension with both white society and the wider Black community, creating its own rules and expectations.

Jefferson dissects this complex inheritance with surgical precision, revealing how cultural upheaval—from civil rights to feminism—collided with the insular world of her youth. The memoir traces the particular burden of perfection demanded by this rarefied environment, where every misstep carried outsized consequences.

What emerges is a fearless examination of identity formation under impossible pressures. Jefferson refuses easy answers, instead mapping the psychological terrain of belonging nowhere completely. Her analysis cuts through assumptions about privilege and pain, showing how protection can become its own form of imprisonment.

His prose moves between tender vulnerability and fierce anger, capturing the exhausting work of fighting for authenticity while navigating racism and homophobia.

This isn't simply a story of struggle—it's an investigation into how we learn to protect ourselves and when we choose to remain open despite the risk. Jones writes with the precision of a poet and the unflinching honesty of someone who has earned his voice through experience, creating a memoir that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant about the cost and necessity of living truthfully.","Jones chronicles his journey as a young Black gay man in the South, weaving poetry and raw honesty into a memoir about family, desire, and the fierce work of becoming yourself.",208,,Biography & Autobiography / Memoirs,Simon & Schuster,08/10/2019,Saeed Jones,"Saeed Jones wrote Prelude to Bruise, which received the 2015 PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for Poetry and the 2015 Stonewall Book Award/Barbara Gittings Literature Award.

From desert pools housing endangered fish species to Icelandic facilities that transform atmospheric carbon into rock, she documents humanity's latest chapter in environmental intervention.

The irony is inescapable—the same technological prowess that brought us to the brink of ecological collapse now represents our primary strategy for planetary rescue. Kolbert encounters researchers breeding heat-resistant coral, physicists designing atmospheric cooling systems, and biologists racing to preserve species in artificial environments. Each story reveals how deeply we've altered Earth's systems and how our responses require ever more complex technological fixes.

This exploration raises fundamental questions about humanity's relationship with the natural world.

Her world consists mainly of professional exchanges with Hijiri, her editor—someone whose vibrant energy stands in stark contrast to her own withdrawn nature. A chance glimpse of herself in a shop window becomes a moment of reckoning, forcing her to confront the woman she's become: someone who has allowed life to happen around her rather than actively participating in it.

This recognition sparks an internal revolution. As she begins dismantling the careful barriers she's built around herself, memories she's long suppressed begin to emerge, threatening the fragile progress she's making. Kawakami navigates the delicate territory between growth and breakdown, showing how the process of becoming authentic often requires confronting the very experiences that shaped our need for protection.

More than a behind-the-scenes look at famous recording sessions, this book examines what it means to dedicate one's life to artistic craft.

Then, on an ordinary summer day, everything changes in an instant. What begins as a routine morning run becomes the moment that divides Amy's life into before and after. The memoir that emerges from this rupture refuses to offer easy consolation or tidy resolution.

Instead, Lin maps the geography of sudden loss with unflinching precision, charting how grief reshapes not just the present but the past itself.

Howard Norman's memoir charts the collision between lived experience and literary imagination, examining how trauma and beauty interweave to create the stories we tell.

From adolescence onward, Norman's path defied convention. A summer spent working on a traveling library introduced him to both literature and heartbreak, while family dysfunction provided an early education in human complexity. His subsequent years in the Arctic—translating Indigenous stories and absorbing their wisdom—offered both refuge and revelation. These remote landscapes became a sanctuary where ancient narratives merged with personal awakening.

Yet even the most carefully constructed life remains vulnerable to chaos. Norman explores how sudden violence can shatter the illusion of safety, transforming familiar spaces into sites of incomprehensible loss. Through it all, he searches for meaning in the fragments—finding that the act of storytelling itself becomes both wound and healing.

Gary Geist faces the weight of inheriting family farmland while pursuing Kismet Poe, whose unpredictable nature both attracts and mystifies him. But Gary isn't the only one captivated—Hugo, whose gentle disposition masks fierce determination, believes Kismet belongs with him instead.

Meanwhile, Kismet's mother Crystal navigates late-night trucking routes, hauling sugar beets while wrestling with her own visions and fears about what lies ahead for her family. Their interconnected stories unfold against the vast Red River Valley, where ancient geological forces meet modern crises—pesticide contamination, climate disruption, and the 2008 financial collapse that makes every dollar spent feel like a gamble.

9780385547512,Book of Lives,A Memoir of Sorts,"Margaret Atwood's memoir opens in the untamed wilderness of northern Quebec, where she spent her formative years alongside parents who valued scientific inquiry and independence. This nomadic existence, following her entomologist father's research through remote forests, created a foundation both solitary and exhilarating.

Atwood weaves together the threads of memory and creation, showing how pivotal experiences became the seeds of her most celebrated works. A particularly difficult period at school would eventually bloom into Cat's Eye, while the unsettling atmosphere of 1980s Berlin provided the backdrop for conceiving The Handmaid's Tale.

The memoir pulses with vivid encounters—literary figures, wildlife, celebrities, and characters who seem lifted from her own fiction.

9780618982509,Are You My Mother?,A Comic Drama,"In this deeply personal graphic memoir, Bechdel examines the intricate dynamics between herself and her intellectually vibrant mother—a woman whose love of literature, theater, and music masked profound disappointments in marriage and motherhood. The relationship fractured early, marked by an absence of physical affection that began in Bechdel's childhood.

Through her signature blend of illustration and introspection, Bechdel investigates this emotional distance, weaving together insights from psychoanalytic theory, unexpected revelations found in children's literature, and reflections on her own romantic relationships. The narrative moves between past and present, theory and memory, as she attempts to understand both her mother's unfulfilled artistic dreams and their lasting impact on their bond.

What emerges is a meditation on creativity, inheritance, and the ways mothers and daughters both wound and shape each other. Bechdel's investigation becomes a form of reconciliation—tentative but genuine—offering insights that will resonate with anyone who has struggled to understand a parent's inner life.","Bechdel follows her acclaimed Fun Home with another brilliant graphic memoir, this time exploring her complex relationship with her artistically gifted mother.

From children drawn to a cursed doll to a bride fleeing toward an encounter with something monstrous from the deep, each narrative creates its own internal logic. An exhausted insomniac discovers unexpected intimacy with a mythical figure, while another character confronts a home consumed by an invasion of insects that defies all reason.

Through these imaginative scenarios, Fu examines the weight of modern existence—our relationship with technology, the complexity of desire, and the ways we grapple with mortality and shame.

Journalist Bianca Bosker found herself captivated by this question after stumbling into New York's elite art scene. Her curiosity led to an immersive investigation that took her from gallery back rooms to museum guard posts, from artist studios to exclusive collector parties.

Bosker embeds herself completely in this rarefied world, learning to stretch canvases until her hands are raw, enduring bizarre performance art, and spending hours studying single artworks as a security guard. She interviews everyone from struggling artists juggling multiple jobs to billionaire collectors who treat art as both passion and investment. Through her journey, she uncovers how the contemporary art world operates—its economics, its social hierarchies, and its cultural influence.

The result is both an entertaining exposé of art world pretensions and a genuine exploration of why visual art continues to matter in our digital age. Bosker examines everything from ancient cave paintings to social media aesthetics, questioning how we see, what we value, and whether beauty still has a place in contemporary culture. Her adventure reveals as much about human nature as it does about art itself.","The Cork Dork author infiltrates New York's exclusive art world with her signature immersive journalism.

If you've ever wondered 'what happened' to art—galleries, critics, collectors—and, of course, artists—then this book is a very companionable start. It's also very funny, to say nothing of very vivid.

9780735224049,The Bright Sword,A Novel of King Arthur,"The age of heroes has ended. Collum, an ambitious young knight, reaches Camelot expecting glory but finds only ruins and regret. Arthur lies dead, his greatest champions scattered or fallen, leaving behind only the Round Table's forgotten members—a Saracen warrior seeking belonging, a court jester elevated beyond his station, and a sorceress haunted by her betrayal of Merlin.

Britain teeters on the edge of chaos as ancient powers stir and Morgan le Fay marshals forces that predate Christianity itself. Without Excalibur, without their king, this ragtag band of survivors faces an impossible task: rebuilding a kingdom from its ashes.

Grossman reimagines the Arthurian cycle through the eyes of those left behind, transforming familiar myths into something startlingly contemporary. Rather than celebrating perfect knights and noble quests, this tale asks harder questions about legacy, failure, and whether broken people can mend a shattered world. The result feels both ancient and immediate—a meditation on how we pick up the pieces when our heroes disappoint us and our certainties crumble.","After King Arthur's death, his surviving misfits—outcasts, fools, and former enemies—must rebuild Camelot from the ruins.

His decision to become a Border Patrol agent stems from a desire to understand the harsh desert terrain that shaped him, but the reality proves more complex than anticipated.

The work transforms him into a tracker of human desperation, someone who navigates between life and death in landscapes that can kill. Each shift brings encounters with people pushed to extremes, forcing Cantú to wrestle with his role in a system that reduces human stories to statistics. The psychological toll eventually drives him away from the uniform.

Yet leaving the Border Patrol doesn't mean escaping its reach. The true test comes through personal connection—a friend's simple journey to see family becomes a nightmare that refuses resolution. Through this crisis, Cantú realizes that borders aren't just geographical lines but forces that reshape everyone they touch, creating wounds that extend far beyond any map.",A former Border Patrol agent chronicles his time policing the U.S.-Mexico border in this searing blend of memoir and moral reckoning.

9780307265746,The Lowland,,"Two brothers grow up sharing everything in 1960s Calcutta—games, secrets, even mistaken identities. Yet their paths diverge dramatically as political upheaval sweeps through India. One brother embraces revolutionary fervor, joining the dangerous Naxalite uprising that promises to reshape society through violence. The other seeks knowledge in American laboratories, trading familiar chaos for scholarly solitude.

Tragedy strikes in the marshy lowland near their childhood home, shattering the family and leaving behind a young widow carrying secrets of her own. The surviving brother faces an impossible choice: remain safely distant in his adopted country, or return to confront the devastating legacy of idealism gone wrong.

Lahiri crafts a story that moves between continents and decades, examining how political conviction can destroy the very bonds it claims to protect.

This is fiction that understands how personal and political forces intertwine, creating reverberations that shape multiple generations.","Two brothers in 1960s Calcutta are bound by love but torn apart when one joins a violent political rebellion.

""Lahiri's work resists pithy quotation, and until now, has avoided fireworks. But [her] first sentence works like a slow fuse.

The institution operates on shifting rules designed to extend imprisonment indefinitely, turning rehabilitation into a cruel game of survival. As months stretch into an uncertain future, Sara must navigate both the facility's oppressive bureaucracy and her fellow inmates' desperation.

The arrival of a rebellious newcomer fractures the center's carefully maintained control, forcing Sara to confront the corporate machinery that has stolen her life. Lalami constructs a terrifying vision of surveillance capitalism taken to its logical extreme, where our most private moments become data points in someone else's profit margin.

9780525561729,Mark Twain,,"Samuel Clemens transformed himself from a Mississippi River pilot into America's most celebrated literary voice, but the journey from small-town Missouri to international fame came at enormous personal cost. Ron Chernow's masterful biography reveals how a restless young man with big dreams reinvented himself as Mark Twain, crafting both a public persona and a body of work that would define American literature.

Chernow traces the evolution of a complex figure who craved recognition while maintaining an outsider's perspective on American society. The man who created Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn lived with equal intensity—throwing himself into risky business schemes that ultimately destroyed his fortune and forced his family into years of exile abroad. Behind the wit and public acclaim lay profound personal tragedies, including the loss of his beloved wife and two daughters.

Drawing from extensive archival research, this biography illuminates how Twain's life mirrored the nation's own growing pains during westward expansion and industrialization. Chernow presents an unflinching examination of America's greatest humorist, a man whose struggles with grief, financial ruin, and moral complexity shaped both his art and his era's understanding of slavery's enduring impact.","Ron Chernow's monumental biography captures the magnificent and often maddening life of Samuel Clemens, the Missouri dreamer who became Mark Twain.

His unit faces relentless challenges from multiple fronts: an elusive enemy, unforgiving terrain, and the corrosive effects of a war that seems to have no clear purpose.

The real complexity emerges from within Bravo Company itself, where racial prejudice and competing egos create fractures as dangerous as any external threat. Leadership failures compound the chaos, leaving young soldiers to navigate impossible choices with insufficient guidance.

As enemy forces close in and the Marines find themselves trapped in hostile territory, the story examines how ordinary individuals respond to extraordinary pressure. Marlantes draws from his own combat experience to illuminate the paradoxes of warfare—the simultaneous presence of terror and loyalty, the way violence can both destroy and forge unbreakable bonds between soldiers.

9780374610487,Absolution,,"The humid streets of 1963 Saigon become the backdrop for an unlikely friendship between two American expatriate women whose lives intersect in unexpected ways. Tricia arrives as an idealistic newlywed, following her husband's engineering assignment that masks deeper intelligence work. Charlene has already mastered the art of corporate wife diplomacy, juggling three children while orchestrating elaborate charitable missions throughout the city.

After a personal tragedy draws Tricia into Charlene's orbit, she finds herself swept into a world of organized benevolence—visiting hospitals, orphanages, and remote colonies with carefully curated gifts and unwavering determination to make a difference. Yet beneath the surface of their good works lies a more complex web of motivations and consequences.

Decades later, an unexpected phone call forces both women to reckon with the true legacy of their time in Vietnam. Through the lens of memory and hindsight, McDermott examines how the desire to do good can become its own form of colonialism, and how the ripple effects of seemingly small actions can reverberate across generations. The novel interrogates the intersection of privilege, power, and genuine compassion in a world where the line between helping and harming proves devastatingly thin.","Two American wives navigate Saigon in 1963, their well-intentioned charity work revealing the complexities of privilege and power.

9780812989786,Known and Strange Things,Essays,"This collection brings together more than fifty essays that showcase Teju Cole's remarkable ability to find unexpected connections across seemingly disparate subjects. His intellectual curiosity leads readers through examinations of everything from classical literature to social media, from presidential politics to terrorist organizations, always with an eye for the overlooked detail that changes everything.

Cole's analytical lens reveals how art and politics intersect in surprising ways. He considers how photographer Roy DeCarava created powerful images of Black subjects despite working with film designed only for white skin, and reexamines James Baldwin's legacy through the lens of contemporary social movements. Perhaps most provocatively, he dissects what he terms the White Savior Industrial Complex, questioning how charitable impulses can mask deeper inequalities.

The essays move fluidly between high and low culture, treating Instagram posts with the same seriousness as Shakespeare's sonnets. Cole's approach suggests that understanding our moment requires this kind of intellectual range—the willingness to see how Virginia Woolf and Barack Obama might illuminate each other, how travel writing and political analysis can be part of the same conversation.","Cole's incisive essays traverse literature, photography, politics, and travel with surgical precision.

After a tragic suicide rocks a tenement building, the Catholic neighborhood responds with silence—burying the truth beneath layers of propriety and religious conviction. But secrets have their own gravity, and this unmentionable death pulls at the lives of everyone it touches.

Sister St. Saviour and her fellow nuns step into the void left behind, caring for the widow and her newborn daughter. As years pass, the weight of what cannot be spoken alters the trajectory of multiple families, testing their capacity for mercy and their understanding of faith. McDermott traces the intricate ways that one moment of anguish echoes across decades, examining how communities both protect and damage those within them. Through the eyes of nuns who tend the sick, women who guard family secrets, and children who sense what adults refuse to name, the novel reveals the complex mathematics of love, duty, and survival in a world where salvation and judgment often wear the same face.","When a desperate Irish immigrant takes his own life in 1920s Brooklyn, the reverberations shape generations.

9780374609849,Grief Is for People,,"Two devastating events collide in Sloane Crosley's life: a break-in that leaves her feeling violated and exposed, followed by the suicide of Russell, one of her dearest friends. The timing feels cruel, almost cosmically unfair, setting the stage for a memoir that refuses to follow conventional patterns of grief writing.

Crosley excavates her friendship with Russell, diving into their shared experiences navigating New York's literary scene, their creative collaborations, and the particular intimacy of chosen family. But this isn't simply a tribute to a lost friend. Instead, she interrogates the nature of security—both physical and emotional—and examines how we construct meaning from seemingly random tragedy.

Her approach combines philosophical inquiry with brutal honesty, weaving together art, memory, and the messy reality of surviving loss. The result challenges readers to reconsider their assumptions about grief while offering unexpected moments of levity. Crosley's voice remains sharp and observant even as she grapples with questions that have no satisfying answers, creating a work that speaks to anyone who has wondered how to keep living after the unthinkable happens.","Following her friend's suicide and a devastating burglary, Crosley transforms profound loss into a darkly funny, deeply moving meditation on friendship and survival.",208,,Biography & Autobiography / Memoirs,MCD,27/02/2024,Sloane Crosley,"Sloane Crosley has written the essay collections I Was Told There'd Be Cake (2009 Thurber Prize finalist), How Did You Get This Number, and Look Alive Out There (2019 Thurber Prize finalist), along with the novels The Clasp and Cult Classic, and the memoir Grief Is for People.

After rescuing the tiny leveret from certain death, Dalton faces the nearly impossible task of keeping a wild creature alive—most hares die quickly in human care, succumbing to stress and captivity.

What begins as a rescue mission evolves into something far more complex: a relationship that challenges conventional notions of care and control. The hare grows into Dalton's nighttime companion, roaming freely through countryside darkness before returning each dawn. Dalton must reconcile her protective instincts with a deeper truth—that genuine love sometimes means accepting the possibility of loss.

This memoir weaves together intimate observations of their daily life with rich explorations of hare mythology, from ancient folklore to contemporary conservation. Dalton examines how these enigmatic creatures have captured human imagination across cultures and centuries. The result is both a deeply personal story of connection and a broader meditation on our relationship with the natural world, revealing how the most profound bonds often emerge from the most unexpected circumstances.","During lockdown in the English countryside, a political advisor rescues an abandoned leveret and forms an unlikely bond.

Jacob de Zoet arrives at this isolated Dutch trading post with clear intentions: accumulate enough wealth in five years to secure his future back home. The confined world of Dejima operates under strict rules, where foreign merchants navigate complex relationships with Japanese officials, interpreters, and locals.

Jacob's calculated plans unravel through his connection with Orito Aibagawa, a skilled midwife whose intelligence and resilience transcend the social barriers that should separate them. Their relationship challenges everything Jacob thought he understood about duty, desire, and the price of crossing forbidden lines.

Mitchell constructs a richly detailed world where East meets West under the most constrained circumstances. The novel examines how individuals navigate between competing loyalties—to homeland, to heart, to survival itself.

9781668045237,Claire McCardell,The Designer Who Set Women Free,"Behind every piece of clothing in your closet lies a revolutionary story you've never heard. Claire McCardell transformed how women dress by refusing to accept that fashion should constrain rather than liberate. While her male contemporaries designed clothes that required assistance to put on and take off, McCardell championed independence through ingenious details like front-facing zippers and functional pockets.

Her innovations reads like a catalog of modern essentials: she pioneered the ballet flat, created the first hoodie, and made separates that could be mixed and matched. But McCardell's true genius lay in understanding that clothing should serve women's actual lives, not some idealized version of femininity imposed by others.

The fashion establishment fought back. When Christian Dior's restrictive ""New Look"" dominated post-war runways, McCardell stood as its antithesis, creating clothes for women who worked, traveled, and lived independently. Her battle wasn't just about hemlines and silhouettes—it was about women's right to move through the world on their own terms.

This biography reveals how one designer's vision became a quiet revolution, proving that the most profound changes often happen in the everyday choices we make about how to present ourselves to the world.","The riveting hidden history of Claire McCardell, the most influential fashion designer you've never heard of.

9780802157065,The Committed,,"In this follow-up to The Sympathizer, our conflicted protagonist finds himself in Reagan-era Paris, where survival means entering the narcotics trade alongside his companion Bon. Still reeling from brutal reeducation experiences, he must navigate the contradictions of French society—a place that both attracts and repels him.

The narrator's integration into Parisian life occurs through an unlikely combination of circumstances: elegant soirées arranged by a Vietnamese expatriate relative connect him to progressive thinkers who become both intellectual companions and clientele for his illicit business. This double existence forces him to balance philosophical discourse with criminal enterprise.

Yet deeper challenges emerge as he confronts his own demons through substance abuse while living under an oppressive system that echoes the colonial structures he thought he'd escaped. Most crucially, he faces the seemingly insurmountable challenge of reconciling his two dearest relationships—Bon and Man—whose ideological differences have created an unbridgeable chasm.

Nguyen crafts a work that operates simultaneously as suspenseful crime fiction and philosophical examination, offering a scorching analysis of friendship, treachery, and the immigrant experience that solidifies his reputation as a major voice in American letters.","The unnamed narrator from The Sympathizer navigates 1980s Paris through drug dealing and left-wing intellectual circles.

—Paul Beatty

""In a decade whose fiction is dominated by autofiction, there's something de´mode´ about Nguyen's novels, which I think can fairly be considered a single artistic endeavor . . . The Sympathizer and The Committed are, to borrow James Wood's phrase for such novels, perpetual-motion machines, their exuberance perhaps a suitable method given how vast a subject he aims to tackle. The breathless voice and sprawling plots of these novels made me think of Midnight's Children: manic language and impossible story suit the strange truth of colonialism. Nguyen does Salman Rushdie one better by deploying the conventions of genre fiction; he gently seduces the reader into two rambling, discursive works passionately interested in war and violence, race and identity, colonialism and history.""

—Rumaan Alam, The New York Times

""The Committed is nothing short of revelatory. As it haunts, bifurcates, and envelops us in its illumination of all that we have failed to notice about the far reaches of colonization, we are also thrilled by its many turns and charms. This book is fierce, and unrelentingly good. Hilarious and subversive, philosophical and hallucinatory, it is much more than a sequel, more like a necessary appendage in a brilliant and expansive anti-colonial body of work, from the twisted and playful mind of the one and only Viet Thanh Nguyen.

Just as she begins to steady herself in Wyoming's rugged landscape, tragedy strikes with devastating finality: her twenty-one-year-old son Fi dies unexpectedly in his sleep.

What follows is a mother's raw journey through uncharted territory of loss. Unlike previous griefs she has endured, this one threatens to break her completely. Yet Fuller refuses to disappear into her pain the way her own mother once did, leaving her surviving daughters behind. Instead, she embarks on a geographical and spiritual odyssey across the Rocky Mountain spine—from isolated sheep wagons to meditation retreats—seeking not answers, but simply a way to continue existing.

Drawing on childhood memories of Zimbabwe's indigenous wisdom, Fuller discovers that healing doesn't follow prescribed paths. Through poetry, ritual, and the unforgiving beauty of nature, she slowly learns that grieving a child requires inventing new ways to be human. This memoir captures both the searing reality of unthinkable loss and the surprising moments of grace that emerge from the wreckage.","A devastating memoir about losing a child, told with the unflinching honesty and unexpected humor that made Fuller's previous work essential reading.

9780593656297,Girl on Girl,How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves,"Feminism seemed unstoppable in the 1990s, yet something shifted dramatically as the new millennium began. Sophie Gilbert dissects this cultural transformation, revealing how the bold, transgressive spirit of third-wave feminism gave way to an era that actively diminished women's agency and dignity.

Through meticulous examination of pop culture artifacts—from reality television's cruel spectacles to tabloid media's predatory practices—Gilbert exposes the mechanisms that engineered this regression. She demonstrates how internet pornography's mainstream emergence fundamentally altered cultural attitudes, while celebrity culture became a vehicle for public humiliation and objectification.

This isn't simply a critique of bad taste or poor judgment. Gilbert uncovers a systematic cultural project that transformed empowered women into infantilized objects of consumption. Her analysis connects seemingly disparate phenomena—fashion trends, music videos, gossip magazines—into a coherent narrative of deliberate disempowerment.

The book serves as both historical reckoning and urgent warning. Gilbert's investigation reveals how the foundations for today's anti-feminist backlash were laid during what many remember as a time of prosperity and progress. Her work challenges nostalgic memories of the early 2000s, demanding we confront the misogynistic machinery that operated beneath the surface glamour.","Atlantic critic Sophie Gilbert excavates the cultural wreckage of the early 2000s, when third-wave feminism collapsed into hyper-objectification and cruelty.

Over and over, Gilbert reminds us: it wasn't always this bad–in fact, it was getting better, then it got taken away. Girl on Girl is a necessary corrective of cultural memory, but more importantly, it is a definitive archive of that disempowerment and its ensuing cruelties.""

Gilbert isn't concerned with softening the blow. Instead, she's intent on snapping millennials out of any instinct to idealize the decades that shaped us—even if that awareness stings.""

""So clear-eyed that it's startling . . . Girl on Girl covers how American culture writ large treated women from the 1990s to the 2010s. It's to Gilbert's credit that she makes a cohesive history emerge from this morass of references . . . Her organization is as confident and nimble as her arguments . . . The informed and persuasive essays in Girl on Girl stand alone, even as they build on one another. A chapter on the early years of reality television is exceptional . . . This ground is well-trod, but rarely trod so well . . . Gilbert is a critic skilled in the art of seeing close-up and faraway all at once, a Vertigo effect of cultural observation. Girl on Girl doesn't settle into outrage or pity, but instead offers a clear-eyed, unblinking stare that conveys one thing: I see what you're doing.""

9780593318256,Wandering Stars,,"The sins of history cast long shadows across generations in this devastating chronicle of survival and institutional cruelty. Beginning with Star, a young man who witnesses unspeakable violence at Sand Creek and later faces systematic erasure at the hands of Richard Henry Pratt, the narrative follows a bloodline marked by trauma and resistance.

Decades pass, but the machinery of cultural destruction grinds on. Star's son Charles finds himself trapped within the walls of Carlisle Indian Industrial School, where the same forces that tormented his father now seek to strip away everything that connects him to his heritage. Yet even in this place designed to break spirits, moments of tenderness emerge—stolen conversations with Opal Viola become acts of rebellion against a system built on erasure.

Orange crafts a story that refuses to let America forget its deliberate attempts to destroy Native identity. This is literature that excavates buried truths, showing how violence ripples through time, shaping not just individuals but entire communities. The result is both heartbreaking and essential—a novel that honors the ancestors while demanding accountability for the wounds that never fully heal.","From the Sand Creek Massacre to modern Oakland, Orange traces a Native family across generations, showing how historical trauma echoes through bloodlines.

Richard Pryor said he wanted to get you laughing so your mouth would be open when he poured the poison down, and that's what Orange is doing here. Anyone can say a complicated thing in a complicated way, but Tommy says the hardest things plain—beyond artifice, beyond confection. That clarity, that radical lucidity, that's the mark of true genius, a word I use here without hyperbole. Think Kafka, Lispector, Borges.

Yet this story extends beyond presidential politics.

The community's unease with the Mansfield family transforms into something far more sinister when whispers begin circulating about mysterious transformations and otherworldly sounds echoing through the night.

Told through the voices of different villagers, this Gothic tale reveals how prejudice and suspicion can poison an entire community. Each narrator brings their own perspective to the growing paranoia, exposing the complex web of resentment, fear, and social dynamics that have long simmered beneath the surface. The sisters, already outsiders in their own home, become scapegoats for anxieties that extend far beyond any actual supernatural threat.

Xenobe Purvis crafts a chilling examination of how societies turn against those who dare to be different, using the framework of historical witch trials to illuminate timeless questions about conformity, power, and the price of being an unconventional woman.

Everything shifts when Ivvár encounters Willa, the minister's own daughter. Their attraction defies the religious and cultural chasms that separate their worlds. As the seasons turn and the herders begin their grueling trek to northern waters, Willa makes a choice that will test the boundaries of love, loyalty, and identity.

Pylväinen captures the raw beauty of the Arctic landscape while examining how faith can both unite and divide communities.

9780307273598,Inferno,"The World at War, 1939-1945","After decades of studying the Second World War, historian Max Hastings presents a comprehensive examination of humanity's most catastrophic conflict. Rather than focusing solely on military strategy or political maneuvering, this work centers the experiences of individuals who lived through six years of global warfare.

The narrative moves between battlefields and home fronts, capturing both the grand sweep of history and its intimate human cost. Hastings draws from extensive research to illuminate familiar episodes alongside lesser-known tragedies—from the desperate conditions endured by civilians during prolonged sieges to the complex dynamics of resistance movements across occupied territories.

The book examines how political leaders navigated impossible choices while ordinary people faced extraordinary circumstances. Hastings explores the moral complexities that emerged during wartime, the breakdown of social order in some regions, and the resilience displayed by communities under extreme duress. His approach reveals how individual stories collectively shaped the war's outcome and legacy.

By balancing strategic analysis with personal accounts, this history demonstrates how the conflict transformed not just national boundaries but the lives of countless individuals across multiple continents. The result is a nuanced portrait that honors both the scale of the tragedy and the humanity of those who endured it.","Hastings delivers a sweeping yet intimate portrait of World War II, weaving together major political developments with the deeply human stories of ordinary people caught in history's most devastating conflict.",729,,History / Wars & Conflicts / World War II,Knopf,01/11/2011,Max Hastings,"Max Hastings has written more than thirty books, including Inferno and The Secret War.

A professional war correspondent who has personally witnessed armed conflict in Vietnam, the Falkland Islands and other danger zones, Hastings has a sober, unromantic and realistic view of battle that puts him into a different category from the armchair generals whose gung-ho, schoolboy attitude to war fills the pages of a great majority of military histories. He writes with grace, fluency and authority…Inferno is superb.""

—Richard J. Evans, The New York Times

""If there is a contemporary British historian who is the chronicler of World War II, it would be Max Hastings…[Inferno] is a true distillation of everything this historian has learned from a lifetime of scholarship-and more important, of real thought-on what he calls 'the greatest and most terrible event in human history.'""

—Martin Rubin, San Francisco Chronicle

""A relatively brief review can only begin to indicate the depth, breadth, complexity and pervasive humanity of this extraordinary book. The literature of World War II is, as Hastings notes at the beginning of his bibliography, so vast as almost to defy enumeration or comprehension, but ""Inferno"" immediately moves to the head of the list. It is in all ways a monumental achievement.""

9780374115739,The Book of My Lives,,"Two cities anchor this unconventional memoir-in-essays: Sarajevo, where childhood unfolds through pickup soccer games and family dynamics, and Chicago, where exile begins unexpectedly. Hemon finds himself stranded in America as war tears through his homeland, watching from afar as his family flees with nothing but their dog.

What emerges isn't a typical immigrant narrative, but something more complex—a meditation on the spaces we call home and the selves we construct within them. Soccer becomes a recurring motif, threading through memories of youth and present-day longing. The author examines how displacement reshapes not just geography but identity itself, while family relationships stretch across continents and transform under pressure.

Hemon refuses easy categorization, blending humor with grief, the mundane with the profound. His essays move between intimate family portraits and broader questions about belonging, creating a work that feels both deeply personal and surprisingly universal. The result challenges readers to reconsider their own assumptions about home, family, and the stories we tell ourselves about who we are.","Essays spanning Sarajevo and Chicago explore displacement, family, and identity with devastating wit.

Russell constructs a tapestry of interconnected lives against this backdrop of crisis: a mystical woman who literally stores the community's memories within her body, a Polish farmer discovering that hoarded fortune brings unexpected consequences, his basketball-playing niece who apprentices with the local witch while wrestling with profound loss, a talking scarecrow, and a government photographer whose supernatural camera captures more than documentary images.

Through these interwoven narratives, Russell excavates the deliberate erasures that built America—the stories communities choose to forget and the histories they refuse to acknowledge. The novel functions as both historical reckoning and contemporary warning, drawing stark parallels between past environmental disasters and our current climate crisis. Russell challenges readers to confront the inherited silences that shape national identity, revealing how collective amnesia perpetuates cycles of harm while also illuminating paths toward redemption and truth-telling.","Five characters' fates intertwine after a devastating dust storm hits Depression-era Nebraska.

Only Karen Russell could write a dust bowl opus with such raucous brio—The Antidote soars with exigent joy and laugh-out-loud scenes, with memory witches and enchanted cameras and the world's most lovable sentient scarecrow. It's magic, a book doing this big work and also making it propulsive, eminently readable.

""This novel swept me up and carried me away, even while somehow burying me, and digging up something about the story of this country I didn't know I needed to know. As with all of Russell's work, heaviness and levity are always kept in balance, and so I was lifted even while being devastated by the book's many brutal truths and stark beauty. I'd already considered Russell's vivid and inventive imagination to be endless, but here exploring a history of Nebraska we get an unearthing of this country's still relatively untold origin story, the part about its original people, and the cost paid in order that this country might be formed. Finishing the book I felt completely covered in the forgotten dust of what too few look back on, with rare clarity, not to mention the intricate braid of narratives masterfully woven here. The Antidote is one, for an all too poisoned American narrative about land and family and belonging.""

Richard Holmes chronicles the extraordinary individuals who first conquered the skies, from the Anglo-French rivalries that sparked aerial competition to the remarkable exploits of pioneers like Sophie Blanchard and John Wise.

These early aviators transformed both science and imagination. James Glaisher's death-defying ascents into the thin air seven miles above Earth laid crucial groundwork for meteorological study, while the mass balloon exodus from besieged Paris became history's first civilian airlift. Holmes reveals how these aerial adventures captured the literary imagination of writers like Mary Shelley and Jules Verne, who recognized flight's power to reshape human perspective.

Blending scientific discovery with personal drama, the narrative spans from Civil War reconnaissance missions to the daredevil performances that thrilled crowds across two continents. Holmes illuminates not just the technical achievements of these balloonists, but the deeper human drive to transcend earthly boundaries and see the world from an entirely new vantage point.","The daring pioneers who first took to the skies in balloons come alive in this captivating cultural history.

Yet their hopes collided with a nation that would soon turn violently against them. This meticulously researched history exposes how America constructed its first racially-based immigration restrictions, targeting Chinese laborers as economic anxieties mounted and white hostility intensified.

Michael Luo reconstructs forgotten episodes of terror: entire communities driven from their homes at gunpoint, individuals murdered by vengeful crowds, and families scattered across a hostile continent. Through figures like herbalist Gene Tong, who died at the hands of a Los Angeles lynch mob, and activist Wong Chin Foo, who courageously challenged discriminatory laws, Luo illuminates both the cruelty these immigrants endured and their remarkable resilience.

The book traces how mass expulsions across the American West created the nation's first undocumented population, while federal exclusion acts established dangerous precedents for racial discrimination. Drawing from archives across the country, Luo connects this buried history to contemporary Asian American experiences, demonstrating how questions of belonging and acceptance continue to shape communities more than a century later.","Michael Luo chronicles the Chinese American experience from the Gold Rush to today, revealing how a community persevered through exclusion laws, violence, and systematic persecution.

9780393242140,Underland,A Deep Time Journey,"Robert Macfarlane takes readers on an extraordinary subterranean odyssey that spans millennia and continents. This remarkable work delves into humanity's relationship with the world beneath our feet, from ancient burial chambers to modern nuclear storage facilities carved deep into bedrock.

Macfarlane's journey carries him through Norwegian caverns adorned with prehistoric art, down into the crystalline depths of Greenland's ice sheet, and through the bone-lined passages of Paris's underground. He discovers the intricate fungal webs that connect forest ecosystems and contemplates repositories designed to safeguard radioactive materials for geological ages.

Throughout these descents, he encounters the stories of those who came before—cave painters, urban explorers, scientists, and visionaries who sought understanding in darkness. The book weaves together mythology, science, and personal reflection to examine our role as stewards of the planet.

A self-proclaimed feminist discovers that his progressive politics mask deeper resentments about his romantic failures. Another character's innocent attraction morphs into destructive fixation, while a sexually inexperienced individual's fumbling attempts at intimacy result in catastrophic consequences.

The stories weave together as characters encounter each other across dating platforms and social networks, creating a web of missed connections and digital humiliations. Tulathimutte captures how technology amplifies our worst impulses, turning ordinary loneliness into performance art.

With razor-sharp wit and unflinching honesty, this collection examines the gap between our romantic fantasies and harsh reality. The author transforms cringe-worthy moments into darkly hilarious commentary on contemporary dating culture, revealing how our need for connection often becomes the very thing that isolates us.","Seven wickedly funny, interconnected stories follow characters whose romantic disasters and digital obsessions reveal the brutal comedy of modern rejection.

9781644450031,In the Dream House,A Memoir,"Carmen Maria Machado transforms personal devastation into literary innovation, dissecting an emotionally destructive relationship through a kaleidoscope of storytelling forms. Rather than following traditional memoir conventions, she fragments her experience across chapters that each adopt different genres and perspectives—from horror tropes to fairy tale analysis.

The book interrogates how we understand and discuss abuse, particularly within queer relationships where narratives of violence are often erased or ignored. Machado weaves together personal reflection with cultural criticism, examining everything from legal frameworks to pop culture representations. Her approach reveals how the same events can yield entirely different meanings depending on the lens through which we view them.

This structural experimentation serves a deeper purpose: showing how trauma resists neat categorization and how survivors must often become archaeologists of their own experiences. The result challenges both memoir as a form and our cultural conversations about intimate violence, creating something that reads like a master class in survival and storytelling.",Each chapter uses a different narrative form to examine an abusive relationship from new angles.

Instead, she finds her family fracturing in disturbing ways: her sister has become consumed by a VR headset called MIND'S EYE, while their mother drifts toward a mysterious religious movement.

The town itself seems infected by strangeness. Feral cats multiply in the streets, neighbors vanish without explanation, and the ghostwriter's own body begins betraying her in impossible ways. Everything escalates during a torrential storm that swallows her sister whole, only to spit her back out days later with wild stories about parallel worlds.

Determined to understand what's happening, the ghostwriter uncovers disturbing links between the tech company behind MIND'S EYE, her famous employer, and the very fabric of what we call real.

Some regions prospered while others suffered devastating consequences.

Despite his efforts to run a clean furniture store, circumstances repeatedly force him into morally ambiguous territory—whether securing concert tickets through corrupt police contacts or investigating suspicious fires that threaten his tenants.

Alongside him stands Pepper, whose talent for violence makes him equally suited for heist work and Hollywood security details. As Harlem transforms around them, both men must navigate a landscape where survival often requires compromising one's principles.

Whitehead constructs a vivid portrait of urban decay and resilience, using crime fiction as a vehicle to examine larger questions about family loyalty, economic necessity, and the costs of trying to build something honest in a dishonest world. The result is both a rollicking caper and a meditation on how ordinary people adapt to extraordinary circumstances, finding humor and humanity even as their city burns around them.","Ray Carney and Pepper navigate 1970s Harlem through three explosive years of crime, corruption, and survival.

It makes this story feel important, not just entertaining, not just suspenseful, not just another surefire bestseller from a beloved author. These are crime novels, yes; funny and fast-paced. They are also the first two installments of a grand historical epic. Novel writing at its best. Bigger and better, together, than anything Whitehead has written before.""

—The Washington Post

""Whitehead's flair for texture is as sharp as ever…Ray, May, Elizabeth and Pepper in particular are by turns exasperating and aspirational. Life gets thrown at them, and they throw themselves back in return.

At the center stands a marriage built on romantic idealism—Gaston and Lucienne's devotion to their own love story becomes both anchor and burden for the generations that follow. Their children, François and Denise, navigate the peculiar isolation of their family's circumstances, while François's marriage to Barbara reveals how cultural divides can persist even in intimacy. Through it all, granddaughter Chloe seeks to understand how family secrets and silences have shaped them all.

Messud constructs a narrative that moves between continents and decades, examining how displacement becomes inheritance. The novel interrogates the stories families tell themselves to survive, and questions whether understanding the past can truly liberate us from it.

The narrative centers on a catastrophic equipment failure at an Arkansas missile facility, but this single incident opens the door to a much larger examination of systemic vulnerabilities within America's atomic infrastructure.

Through meticulous research and exclusive interviews, Schlosser exposes the uncomfortable truth about nuclear safety: despite sophisticated safeguards and dedicated personnel, the combination of human fallibility and mechanical complexity creates an ongoing dance with disaster. The book illuminates how military leaders, engineers, and politicians have grappled with weapons designed to end civilization while simultaneously trying to prevent their accidental deployment.

Teaching elementary school in Cambridge, she exists on the periphery of more exciting lives—until the Shahids arrive and everything changes.

The family captivates her immediately: Reza, a sensitive boy in her class; Skandar, his charismatic Lebanese academic father; and Sirena, his magnetic Italian artist mother who seems to embody everything Nora has denied herself. What begins as concern for young Reza after a bullying incident evolves into something far more consuming.

Drawn into their sophisticated orbit, Nora experiences an awakening that threatens to demolish the careful constraints she's built around her life. Her dormant hunger for art, passion, and recognition resurfaces with startling intensity. But this intoxicating proximity to the life she's always wanted forces Nora to confront uncomfortable truths about desire, friendship, and the price of self-denial. Messud crafts a fierce examination of middle-aged reinvention and the dangerous allure of other people's seemingly perfect lives.","Elementary school teacher Nora Eldridge has settled into life as the reliable woman upstairs until the glamorous Shahid family awakens her buried dreams and desires.

Tom Rachman's debut novel dissects the peculiar ecosystem of expatriate media, where professional ambition collides with personal catastrophe in darkly comic ways.

Each character inhabits their own brand of professional purgatory: an editor whose marriage crumbles as spectacularly as her newspaper's circulation, an obituary writer jolted from complacency by his own brush with mortality, and a cost-cutting executive whose romantic entanglements complicate her ruthless efficiency. Beyond the newsroom, correspondents navigate their own moral compromises—a Paris veteran chasing relevance through increasingly questionable means, and a naive Cairo reporter manipulated by a cynical war correspondent.

Presiding over this media menagerie is an eccentric publisher more devoted to his philosophical dog than to preserving his family's journalistic legacy. As digital media reshapes the industry and threatens the paper's survival, the institution's founding mythology slowly unravels, exposing the gap between idealistic origins and messy reality.

""In his zinger of a debut, Rachman deftly applies his experience as foreign correspondent and editor to chart the goings-on at a scrappy English-language newspaper in Rome. Chapters read like exquisite short stories, As the ragtag staff faces down the implications of the paper's tilt into oblivion, there are more than enough sublime moments, unexpected turns and sheer inky wretchedness to warrant putting this on the shelf next to other great newspaper novels.""

Through multiple perspectives, the narrative weaves between a water company owner concealing family secrets, an architect daughter he refuses to claim, and a drug dealer yearning for love amid chaos.

The disaster exposes hidden connections: business partners convinced they're stalked by supernatural forces, a Boston taxi driver whose music carries memories of home, and a displaced woman whose lost children seem to visit her dreams. An elderly market vendor serves as the community's living memory, recognizing faces and stories that span generations.

Chancy constructs a mosaic of survival that transcends the immediate catastrophe, revealing how personal histories intersect with national trauma.

9780593299821,The Barn,The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi,"Seventy years after Emmett Till's brutal death shook the nation, investigative threads that authorities failed to follow finally lead somewhere. Wright Thompson's meticulous detective work pieces together what really happened to the fourteen-year-old Chicago boy in the Mississippi Delta, challenging the incomplete narrative that has persisted for decades.

Through years of research and interviews, Thompson maps out the actual location where Till died and identifies witnesses whose voices were never heard. His investigation reveals how economic interests, racial terror, and institutional failures created a web of silence that protected the killers and denied justice to Till's family.

Beyond solving a cold case, Thompson examines how this single act of violence reflects larger patterns of American power and complicity. He traces the historical forces that made such brutality possible while celebrating the determination of those who refused to let the truth disappear entirely. The result is both a reckoning with past sins and a meditation on whether genuine reconciliation remains possible.","Thompson uncovers shocking new evidence about Emmett Till's murder, revealing how global forces converged on the Mississippi Delta and why the truth remained buried for decades.",448,,"History / United States / State & Local / South (AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA, WV)",Penguin Press,24/09/2024,Wright Thompson,"Wright Thompson has written the bestselling books Pappyland and The Cost of These Dreams.

While sifting through the dirt that buried the facts about Till's death, Thompson credits the work of the historians, journalists and filmmakers who have sought to tell the true tale. But he crafts a wider, deeper narrative. The Barn is serious history and skillful journalism, but with the nuance and wallop of a finely wrought novel . . . The Barn describes not just the poison of silence and lies, but also the dignity of courage and truth.""

—The Washington Post

""The Barn is the most brutal, layered and absolutely beautiful book about Mississippi, and really how the world conspired with the best and worst parts of Mississippi, I will ever read. In Mississippi, we talk about athletes who bust their ass, skills be damned. Well, every generation you get a few writers with the engine of a 747 and the skill of a wizard. We see it in Ward, Wright, Faulkner and Trethewey. And that finely crafted motor is on full display in this work by Wright Thompson. The Barn is the new standard in research and book-making. There is one Wright Thompson. And we are so lucky he loves Mississippi. Reporting and reckoning can get no better, or more important, than this. Mississippi, goddamn.""

—Kiese Laymon, author of Long Division and Heavy: An American Memoir

""Geography, wrote Ralph Ellison, is fate—an axiom painstakingly proven in the compelling architecture of Wright Thompson's The Barn. Though grounded in a small radius within the landscape of Mississippi, this capacious examination of a terrible history is both expansive and granular, national and personal. Thompson writes with a tone of relentless urgency at once tempered by a deep reflection on what becomes, ultimately, a seemingly unavoidable trajectory, a cataclysmic inevitability—the consequences of material greed and cruel disregard—into which our nation and the people in it were thrust. He writes, too, with a true storyteller's gift for language and image, and the ability to make grand connections across time and space, to see all the forces culminating in one terrible moment, all the lives destroyed or forever marked by what happened that night. Follow them though time, Thompson writes—and we do—into a world not only harrowing but also, we come to see, redeemable when the act of remembering, of looking unflinchingly at the troubled fabric of our nation is itself a kind of accountability, and redemption.""

Carvell Wallace transforms his personal reckoning into something far more expansive than typical trauma narratives, crafting instead a luminous exploration of what it means to rebuild oneself.

Drawing from his experiences navigating America as both Black and queer, Wallace refuses to center suffering as the defining element of his story. Instead, he traces the contours of resilience through moments both intimate and universal: finding shelter with a young mother during periods of homelessness, adapting to life in an isolating Pennsylvania town, learning to love and parent while the world seems increasingly unstable.

The same incisive lens Wallace applies to his celebrated profiles now illuminates his own existence, revealing how identity, family, sexuality, and mortality intersect in unexpected ways.

The talented friend pursues professional dance but finds herself struggling with the realities of grown-up existence. Meanwhile, her former companion reinvents herself as an aide to Aimee, a global superstar, gaining intimate access to wealth and celebrity culture.

Aimee's humanitarian interests eventually draw the narrative to West Africa, where multiple worlds collide: heritage-seeking visitors from the diaspora, local young people pursuing uncertain futures, and women whose movements echo the same rhythms that once connected two London girls. Through these intersecting stories, Smith examines how personal relationships mirror larger questions of privilege, cultural exchange, and the forces that both unite and divide us across continents.","Childhood friends from London take divergent paths—one becomes a dancer, the other assists a pop star whose philanthropy leads them to West Africa.

Working at a talent agency by day and exercising obsessively by night, she's built a life around denial—until a therapeutic experiment separates her from her calorie-counting mother for three months.

This imposed silence creates space for something unexpected: Miriam, an Orthodox woman who works at Rachel's usual frozen yogurt haunt and seems determined to nourish her. Their connection defies everything Rachel thought she understood about herself, pulling her into unfamiliar territory where abundance replaces scarcity.

Broder crafts a story that moves between the sacred and profane, examining how we feed ourselves—and what we starve. Rachel's attraction to Miriam opens questions about faith, family, and the body's wisdom that her years of self-denial have silenced. The novel interrogates the complicated relationship between control and surrender, asking whether true satisfaction requires abandoning the safety of limitation for something more dangerous: actually wanting what we want.","When Rachel meets Miriam at a frozen yogurt shop, their relationship becomes a reckoning with hunger, faith, and desire.

Already grappling with career disappointments and a crumbling marriage, Frida finds herself thrust into a government program designed to evaluate and reform supposedly inadequate mothers.

The institution operates like a laboratory for parenting, where every gesture of affection and moment of care becomes subject to clinical measurement. Here, women who dared to be imperfect—who glanced at phones, allowed independence, showed human weakness—must demonstrate their worthiness to remain mothers.

Chan constructs a world that feels disturbingly familiar, where societal expectations of maternal perfection become weaponized against women themselves. The novel interrogates how quickly love can be pathologized and how institutions can colonize the most intimate relationships. Through Frida's ordeal, we witness both the absurdity and cruelty of systems that claim to protect children while terrorizing their mothers.

This is a story about the impossible standards imposed on women, the ways society surveils and punishes maternal imperfection, and the fierce determination of a mother fighting to reclaim her child.

""Jessamine Chan captures, in heartbreaking tones, the exacting price women pay in a patriarchal society that despises them, that reduces their worth to their viability for procreation and capacity for mothering. The School for Good Mothers is not so much a warning for some possible dystopian nightmare as much as it is an alarm announcing that the nightmare is here. The book is, thus, a weeping testimony, a haunting song, and a piercing rebuke of both the misogynist social order and the traps it lays for women, girls, and femmes. Good Mothers deserves an honored place next to the works of Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler.""

This ambitious novel traces how a single ancient tale about a man who dreams of becoming a bird ripples through different eras, touching five distinct lives in unexpected ways.

In Constantinople's final days, a young girl discovers this forgotten story while the city crumbles around her. Centuries later, an elderly man brings the same tale to life for children in an Idaho library, unaware that danger lurks nearby. Far in the future, a solitary woman aboard a spacecraft preserves these same words on whatever materials she can find.

Each character faces their own form of isolation—whether behind city walls, in small-town America, or in the vast emptiness of space. Yet the ancient story becomes their bridge to something larger than themselves. Doerr examines how literature serves as both refuge and revelation, offering solace to those who feel displaced in their own time. The novel asks profound questions about what we choose to preserve and why certain stories refuse to die, even as civilizations rise and fall around them.",Five dreamers across centuries—from besieged Constantinople to a future spaceship—find connection through an ancient story about transformation and hope.

In a London theater, a renowned novelist sits watching his daughter's latest production, slowly realizing she has transformed their shared memories into art that exposes his deepest flaws.

The story unfolds across two timelines: the present-day performance and a pivotal summer in Sicily years earlier, where father and daughter worked together on his manuscript. What seemed like collaboration now reveals itself as something far more complex—a young woman bearing witness to attitudes and behaviors that would later fuel her creative reckoning.

This debut novel examines how each generation inherits the moral debris of the last, and whether understanding can bridge the gap between old certainties and new consciousness. As the theatrical performance progresses, the boundaries between memory and imagination, between lived experience and artistic interpretation, begin to dissolve. The result is a meditation on family, art, and the courage required to confront uncomfortable truths about the people we love.","A playwright transforms her novelist father's moral failings into devastating theater.

Their relationship becomes a sanctuary of tenderness in a world designed to strip away humanity. Yet their love faces a devastating threat from within their own community—a fellow enslaved person who seeks the master's approval by condemning what he sees as transgression.

Robert Jones, Jr. weaves together multiple perspectives in this sweeping narrative, giving voice to both the oppressed and their oppressors. The story examines how systems of control pit the powerless against one another, forcing impossible choices between survival and authenticity. Through lyrical prose, the novel interrogates the intersection of desire, spirituality, and resistance.

As community fractures deepen and long-simmering tensions reach a breaking point, the narrative builds toward a devastating confrontation that will determine the fate of all involved.

Kushner captures the absurd bureaucracy and brutal hierarchies that govern this enclosed world, finding dark comedy amid genuine tragedy. Her prose illuminates the humanity that persists even in the most dehumanizing circumstances, revealing how women adapt, resist, and endure when society has written them off. This is neither a redemption story nor a simple condemnation—instead, it examines what it means to be forgotten by the outside world while fighting to maintain one's identity within prison walls.

Holly has always been different—she hears voices others can't, experiences visions that blur the line between reality and something far more mysterious. Her angry departure from home sets in motion events that will haunt her for decades.

Holly's psychic sensitivity draws her into an ancient conflict between opposing mystical factions, transforming what should have been a brief escape into something that permanently alters her family's fate. The reverberations of this encounter will follow Holly through every stage of her life, connecting her story to seemingly unrelated characters: an ambitious Cambridge student chasing success, a war correspondent finding purpose in dangerous places, and a novelist grappling with fading relevance.

Confined during quarantine, a woman finds herself drawn into the world of Herman Melville—not just his famous whale tale, but the messy realities of his domestic life. She traces his impulsive real estate decisions, his creative struggles at his Massachusetts farm, his complicated friendship with Hawthorne, and the strain his artistic dedication placed on his marriage.

What begins as literary curiosity evolves into something more consuming. Her research expands to encompass other writers and biographers, including Elizabeth Hardwick and Robert Lowell, whose personal sacrifices for art mirror Melville's own. Through these literary lives, she begins examining the uncomfortable questions about creativity, commitment, and compromise that thread through her own existence.

This meditation on artistic obsession becomes unexpectedly personal, forcing her to confront the tensions within her own marriage and the true cost of creative ambition. The novel explores how we seek understanding through the lives of others, and how the stories we tell about writers reveal as much about ourselves as about them.","During quarantine, a woman's obsession with Herman Melville's life becomes a reckoning with her own marriage and ambition.

Living in sparse quarters attached to a crumbling castle by the sea, he has crafted a solitary existence where days pass without human contact. The isolation suits him—or so he believes. His thoughts drift between the present quiet and fragments of his former life: images of his wife June, their children Winnie and Joe, the weight of years spent in police work.

This fragile equilibrium shatters when two detectives arrive, reopening a case that has festered in Tom's memory for decades. What begins as routine questioning evolves into something more unsettling, forcing Tom to confront not just the unresolved investigation, but the deeper mysteries of loss, memory, and survival.

Barry crafts a meditation on how the past refuses to stay buried, examining the stories we tell ourselves and the truths we cannot escape. The novel moves between what Tom remembers and what he has forgotten, between the official version of events and the emotional reality beneath. In this liminal space—between retirement and reckoning, between solitude and connection—Tom must navigate the treacherous territory of his own history.","Retired policeman Tom Kettle seeks solitude by the Irish Sea, haunted by memories of his family.

Barry reaches deep into the messenger bag of mystery fiction and turns the whole business inside out to show the soft suede of its lining and the loosening stitches of the seams . . .

At the story's heart lies a marriage in quiet crisis—Dan and Isabel navigate their complicated feelings not just for each other, but for Isabel's charismatic brother Robbie, whose presence both binds and destabilizes their household.

Cunningham structures his narrative around three April days across consecutive years, each revealing new fractures and attempted repairs. The first finds the family at a crossroads as Robbie prepares to leave their shared home. The second traps them in pandemic isolation, where proximity breeds both protection and claustrophobia—young Violet becomes a guardian of windows and safety while her brother Nathan pushes against her anxious boundaries.

Their unlikely alliance challenges everything both men thought they understood about duty, survival, and human connection.

These eight stories follow young women caught between competing worlds—navigating predominantly white academic spaces while grappling with family expectations, confronting unplanned pregnancies that threaten carefully laid plans, and wrestling with relationships that expose deep-seated insecurities about belonging.

Evans creates characters who are whip-smart yet vulnerable, aware of systemic inequalities but still stumbling through the universal awkwardness of coming of age. A college student questions her place among privileged peers. A daughter discovers how much distance has grown between herself and her father. A teenager spends a summer with her white grandmother that reshapes her understanding of family and race.

Yet something nags at Conway about the victim, a sense of recognition she can't quite place.

Faye abandoned her family years ago, leaving behind only questions and hurt. Now she's at the center of a media firestorm, accused of a bizarre act that has the entire country taking sides.

The woman splashed across headlines bears little resemblance to the quiet girl Samuel remembers from his childhood. Determined to separate truth from sensationalism, he begins investigating his family's history, following a trail that leads him from the American Midwest all the way back to Norwegian folklore and the legend of the Nix—a mythical creature that haunts those who betray the ones they love.

What Samuel discovers forces him to question everything he believed about his mother, his family, and himself.

Caught between family tensions and the relentless demands of motherhood, she finds herself retreating to the bathroom with headphones, desperately seeking silence. But when her breaking point finally arrives, she makes a decision that changes everything: she buys a bus ticket to wherever it will take her farthest from home.

What follows is ten days that stretch into a decade-long reckoning. April's impulsive escape becomes something far more complex—a reckoning with inherited pain, a search for identity beyond the roles others have assigned her, and ultimately a confrontation with what it means to love someone enough to hurt them. Through April's voice, speaking directly to her daughter years later, Hudes crafts an intimate meditation on the impossible mathematics of motherhood and the courage required to break patterns that have defined generations.

This political spider weaves webs of control that span decades, but Sogolon possesses both the cunning and audacity to challenge such consolidated power.

Their conflict stretches across a full century, revealing how personal vendettas can reshape kingdoms and how different visions of rule clash in spectacular fashion.

Their bond deepens in a class examining alternative histories, where casual mention of D'aron's hometown tradition—a Civil War commemoration now sanitized as ""Patriot Days""—ignites academic outrage.

Fueled by campus activism and their own cultural blind spots, the quartet embarks on a misguided mission to the rural South.

The narrative examines the relationship between possession and identity, exploring whether owning pieces of famous figures can somehow transfer their genius or significance.

What makes this work particularly unique is its collaborative genesis—emerging from a partnership with factory workers, it challenges traditional notions of authorship and literary creation.

9780307960726,The Infatuations,,"María Dolz finds herself drawn into the daily rhythms of strangers, watching a couple during her morning coffee routine in Madrid. Their apparent contentment becomes a refuge from her own unremarkable life—until violence intrudes with shocking brutality.

The husband's murder on the street transforms María's passive observation into active involvement. She seeks out the grieving widow, ostensibly to express sympathy, but this gesture leads her into unexpected territory. Through another man connected to the tragedy, she discovers that the crime harbors secrets that challenge everything she believed about the couple she had idealized.

Marías weaves together the threads of a criminal investigation with deeper questions about human connection and self-deception. The novel examines how we construct narratives to make sense of chaos, and how our need for meaning can lead us to embrace comfortable fictions over uncomfortable realities. María's journey from observer to participant reveals the dangerous allure of other people's lives and the complex relationship between witnessing and understanding.","A woman's morning café ritual becomes an obsession with a perfect couple—until murder shatters the illusion.

In the aftermath of her mother's death, the eleven-year-old finds herself caught between grief and her father's relentless expectations on the court. The sport that once brought joy now serves as both refuge and prison, creating distance between Gopi and her sisters while forging unexpected connections with fellow players.

Maroo crafts an intimate portrait of a young girl navigating trauma through athletic obsession. The squash court becomes a place where relationships form in silence—with her father, with Ged, a talented boy who shares her dedication, and with the ghosts of players who came before. Each game strips away another layer of childhood, revealing how we sometimes lose ourselves in the very things meant to save us.

9781324074410,Atavists,Stories,"In biology, an atavism describes when ancient traits suddenly reappear in modern organisms. Lydia Millet borrows this concept to examine how primal impulses break through the veneer of civilized life in her interconnected story collection.

The characters populating these tales find themselves caught between who they think they should be and the raw emotions that drive them. A bartender struggles to make sense of his place in the world. A mother becomes fixated on her son-in-law's supposed sexual proclivities. A fitness enthusiast nurses dangerous resentments about women and society. An academic's career crumbles under accusations of intellectual theft.

Millet captures the particular anxiety of living in contemporary America, where cultural divisions feel increasingly unbridgeable. Her protagonists stumble through moments both mundane and profound—a beauty treatment interrupted by devastating news, a couple's attempt to identify their anonymous tormentor, a professional's descent into obsessive behavior after romantic rejection.

Through these interconnected narratives, Millet dissects the gap between our aspirations and our actions.

This sharp-tongued feminist intellectual has spent decades fighting battles both public and personal, and now, at seventy-five, she's determined to claim her solitude and finally tackle the memoir that's been calling to her.

But family has a way of disrupting even the most carefully constructed boundaries. Her son Daniel arrives from Seattle with his wife and teenage daughter in tow, bringing their messy complications straight into Florence's ordered existence. As three generations collide under one roof, Florence finds herself navigating not just family dynamics but also the unsettling changes in her own body that hint at mortality's approach.

Brian Morton crafts a story that refuses easy sentiment, instead offering the complex reality of a woman who has never softened her edges for anyone's comfort. Florence's razor-sharp observations cut through pretense and self-deception, yet even her formidable intellect cannot shield her from life's fundamental vulnerabilities. This is an unflinching examination of what it means to age with dignity while remaining true to oneself, even when the people we love most challenge our carefully constructed defenses.","Seventy-five-year-old Florence Gordon—blunt, brilliant, and fiercely independent—finally has time to write her memoir.

This ethereal tale intertwines romance, grief, and humanity's eternal quest for purpose against the backdrop of our fragmented modern existence. Libraries and literature itself become central characters, transformed into sacred spaces where narratives find refuge and continue to pulse with life. Murakami constructs a story that transcends time while addressing the anxieties of our post-pandemic era, employing his distinctive fusion of supernatural elements with everyday reality.

Equal parts romantic odyssey and existential inquiry, The City and Its Uncertain Walls demonstrates Murakami's artistic maturity. He creates a universe governed by the fluid rules of dreams yet anchored in recognizable human experience, where the lines separating recollection from invention, the tangible from the imagined, dissolve into something luminous and profound.","Murakami returns to his enigmatic Town where dreams are catalogued and shadows drift free.

Facing systematic discrimination and the challenge of existing in a society that never intended to include them, these unlikely restaurateurs must forge alliances with their patrons and neighbors.

Elena Richardson has built her life around these principles, finding comfort in predictability and social conventions.

This carefully maintained equilibrium shatters with the arrival of Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl. Mia's artistic sensibilities and unconventional choices clash with everything Elena holds sacred. As the Warren women integrate into the Richardson family's orbit, their presence exposes the fault lines beneath Shaker Heights' polished surface.

A local adoption case becomes the catalyst for deeper divisions. The legal battle over a Chinese-American infant forces residents to confront uncomfortable truths about privilege, race, and belonging. Elena and Mia find themselves on opposite sides, their philosophical differences escalating into personal warfare.

Elena's determination to expose Mia's hidden past transforms into dangerous obsession. The investigation she launches will unravel more than just one woman's secrets—it threatens to destroy the very foundations both women have built their identities upon.

Ng crafts an intimate examination of how families fracture under pressure. Each family member carries private burdens and unspoken disappointments that have accumulated over years of trying to belong in a community where they stand apart. The novel reveals how love can become suffocating when filtered through unfulfilled ambitions, and how the desire to protect can inadvertently isolate.

Laughter emerges as both shield and salve, while the boundaries between strangers begin to dissolve through simple gestures of kindness.

Among them is Alice, for whom these daily swims represented far more than exercise—they were her lifeline against advancing dementia. The structured environment and familiar faces provided crucial anchoring points as her mind began to slip. Now, without this essential routine, Alice tumbles deeper into confusion and displacement.

Memories flood back with overwhelming intensity: her childhood, the trauma of internment during World War II, fragments of a life she's struggling to hold onto. Meanwhile, her daughter watches helplessly as her mother's condition accelerates, their relationship complicated by years of distance and misunderstanding.

Otsuka weaves together themes of community, ritual, and the devastating fragility of human connection.

The survivors face a reality that defies logic, leaving them to navigate grief without closure and search for meaning in chaos.

Mayor Kevin Garvey finds himself at the center of this upheaval, tasked with holding his community together while watching his own family splinter. Each member of the Garvey household responds to trauma differently—some seek solace in mysterious movements, others chase false prophets, and still others retreat into themselves entirely.

Perrotta weaves together the personal and universal, showing how catastrophe ripples through individual lives and entire communities. The novel examines our desperate need for explanations in an inexplicable world, and questions whether faith can survive when everything we thought we knew crumbles. With his signature blend of humor and heartbreak, Perrotta creates a story that feels both surreal and deeply human.","After millions vanish in a mysterious global event, the survivors grapple with grief, faith, and shattered certainties.

The cult horror filmmaker has maintained complete anonymity for decades, emerging only through his disturbing cinematic works that have spawned devoted followers and whispered legends.

McGrath's obsession with exposing Cordova previously destroyed his personal and professional life, yet he cannot resist this new opportunity to penetrate the director's carefully constructed mystery. Accompanied by unexpected companions, the journalist descends into a world where the boundaries between Cordova's fictional horrors and reality become increasingly unclear.

The investigation transforms into something far more dangerous than McGrath anticipated, as he discovers that proximity to the Cordova family comes with a price.

9780393635522,The Overstory,,"Trees hold secrets that most humans never discover—until a disparate group of individuals begins to perceive what has been hidden in plain sight all along. A Vietnam veteran's survival depends on an ancient banyan's embrace. A woman inherits decades of photographs chronicling a single chestnut tree's fate. After a near-death experience, a student finds herself guided by luminous beings toward a deeper understanding of the living world.

As these characters—along with others who have stumbled upon nature's hidden language—cross paths, they become unlikely allies in a battle to protect America's remaining old-growth forests. Their personal awakenings mirror a larger reckoning with humanity's place in an ecosystem far more complex and sentient than most people imagine.

Powers constructs a narrative that mirrors the very forests it celebrates: interconnected, layered, and pulsing with life that extends far beyond individual stories. The novel interrogates whether humans can learn to see beyond their own brief existence to recognize the ancient intelligence that surrounds them, and what it might cost—or save—to finally listen.","Nine strangers find their lives transformed by trees, leading them to a desperate fight to save ancient forests.

At thirty-three, he's finally found purpose preparing to portray Christ in his New Mexico town's Easter ceremony—until Angel's pregnancy forces him to confront a different kind of responsibility.

What unfolds is a year-long examination of family bonds stretched to their limits. Three generations of women—Angel's grandmother Yolanda, her estranged mother Marissa, and the determined teenager herself—circle around Amadeo, each carrying their own wounds and expectations. Meanwhile, the family patriarch Tíve watches with disapproval as old patterns threaten to repeat.

Valdez Quade crafts an intimate portrait of people trying to break cycles they barely understand. As Angel's baby grows, so do the questions about what it means to be worthy of love, whether redemption is possible for the deeply flawed, and how families survive when everyone is drowning. The result is a deeply human story about the gap between who we want to be and who we actually are, set against the backdrop of a community where faith and failure walk hand in hand.","When pregnant fifteen-year-old Angel arrives at her unemployed father's doorstep during Holy Week, five generations of a New Mexican family must navigate love, sacrifice, and redemption together.",432,,Fiction / Hispanic & Latino,W.

Each family member has retreated into their own form of isolation, nursing wounds both personal and ideological. The prospect of reunion threatens to resurrect questions they've avoided: How do we reconcile family loyalty with moral conviction? Can love survive the collision of identity, politics, and loss?

Row constructs a sprawling narrative that refuses to stay within traditional boundaries, weaving together multiple perspectives and global contexts. The novel interrogates the American family as a site where private grief intersects with larger questions of race, justice, and belonging.

She abandons her medical career for restaurant work while he navigates adolescence caught between two languages, two cultures, and an emerging sense of himself that doesn't fit traditional expectations.

Their relationship becomes the novel's emotional center—intense, complicated, sometimes suffocating in its devotion. As he matures and moves to New York, romantic relationships offer glimpses of connection but never quite fill the void left by displacement. The pull of family and homeland eventually draws him back to Colombia, where long-buried family truths finally surface.

Sanchez examines how immigration reshapes not just geography but identity itself, particularly for those who must also reconcile their sexuality with cultural expectations. The novel interrogates what it means to belong when you exist in the spaces between—between countries, between languages, between the person your family expects and the person you're becoming.

Characters separated by decades and centuries find themselves mysteriously linked through objects, places, and unfinished business that refuses to stay buried.

At the collection's heart lies a tale of two men documenting folk music in Maine's wilderness during World War I, their recordings destined to surface generations later in ways that reshape understanding of their journey. From colonial Nantucket's windswept shores to modern New Hampshire's dense forests, Shattuck weaves a complex web where past and present collide.

What emerges is something far more ambitious than traditional storytelling—a living map of New England where memories crystallize in unexpected forms. Family histories unravel and reconstitute, revealing how trauma and tenderness move through bloodlines like underground rivers. Shattuck demonstrates remarkable skill in showing how artifacts carry emotional weight across generations, transforming simple objects into vessels of profound meaning.

This collection operates as both archaeological dig and love song, unearthing the layers of human experience that accumulate in landscapes we call home.","Twelve interconnected stories span three centuries of New England history, where mysteries from one tale find resolution in another.

Smith weaves these contemporary fragments together with the story of a medieval metalworker, cast out from her community and forced to wander. The connection between a woman navigating pandemic restrictions and a craftsperson surviving plague-era persecution reveals unexpected parallels between our current moment and humanity's distant past.

This latest work examines how stories function not as neat conclusions but as ongoing inquiries into meaning. Through wordplay and temporal shifts, Smith creates a meditation on resilience, creativity, and the threads that bind disparate experiences across time.

As István moves into adulthood, he exists in a state of perpetual drift, dependent on the kindness or calculated interests of others who cross his path. His journey takes unexpected turns, leading him far from the formative experiences that shaped his youth, yet never truly allowing him to escape their influence.

Szalay constructs a meditation on disconnection through fragments of István's life across multiple decades.

A babysitter confronts her limits when faced with an uncontrollable child. Teenagers discover how quickly social friction can escalate into something darker and more dangerous. At the center of several narratives, a young man finds himself entangled with a couple whose open relationship becomes a laboratory for examining trust, jealousy, and the risks of emotional exposure.

Their unlikely bond becomes a catalyst, forcing both men to examine uncomfortable truths about race, art, and authenticity. What does it mean to create under the weight of others' expectations?

As Joseph moves through his demanding routine of academic work, medical emergencies, and parenting responsibilities, he begins an unexpected journey toward comprehending this complicated paternal legacy.

His friendship with fellow veteran Ray provides both anchor and mirror—two men attempting to translate wartime brotherhood into civilian connection while battling their own demons. Together they navigate the particular challenges of Black masculinity, the weight of systemic inequities, and the gap between intellectual understanding and lived reality. Thomas constructs a nuanced portrait that refuses easy answers, examining how individuals survive within larger structures of power, punishment, and possibility.","A veteran returns from Iraq to navigate doctoral studies, EMS work, and single fatherhood while reckoning with his imprisoned father's legacy.

9780593087480,The Books of Jacob,,"An enigmatic stranger materializes in an 18th-century Polish village, eventually claiming the identity of Jacob Frank—a figure destined to challenge the religious establishment across two empires. This self-proclaimed prophet accumulates devoted followers while cycling through faiths, embracing Islam before turning to Catholicism, all while being denounced as both charlatan and savior.

Frank's journey cuts through the Habsburg and Ottoman territories, leaving disruption in his wake as whispers of forbidden ceremonies and radical theology spread. Tokarczuk builds her narrative around this actual historical enigma, weaving together testimonies from believers, enemies, confidants, and skeptics to create a kaleidoscopic portrait of a man who defied categorization.

Set against the backdrop of a continent in flux, the novel examines humanity's eternal struggle between doubt and faith, tradition and revolution. The story unfolds through competing voices—each offering their own interpretation of Frank's true nature—while the book itself mirrors ancient Hebrew tradition by numbering its pages backward from 955 to 1, creating a reading experience that moves against conventional time.","Tokarczuk's Nobel Prize-winning epic follows the rise and fall of Jacob Frank, a real historical figure who blazed across eighteenth-century Europe as a messianic leader, upending religious and social order.",992,,Fiction / Biographical & Autofiction,Riverhead Books,01/02/2022,Olga Tokarczuk,"Olga Tokarczuk stands among contemporary literature's most celebrated voices, having received both the Nobel Prize in Literature and the International Booker Prize alongside numerous other distinctions.

Their parents' relationship burns hot and cold—a Puerto Rican father and white mother whose intense bond shapes everything around them. The boys find adventure in everyday moments, crafting toys from scraps and seeking refuge when adult conflicts erupt.

Told through the eyes of the youngest brother, the story captures how children experience love as something both protective and overwhelming. As he grows older, his understanding of his place in the family—and the world beyond it—begins to shift in unexpected ways.

Torres examines how our earliest relationships forge our sense of self, even as we inevitably outgrow them. The novel traces that delicate moment when childhood's fierce loyalties give way to the pull of individual identity, revealing both the pain and necessity of that transformation.","Three mixed-race brothers navigate a childhood of chaos, violence, and fierce love in upstate New York.

The years have created distance and hurt between the childhood friends, leaving both men uncertain how to bridge the gap that separates them.

As Cam navigates the weight of loss and the delicate work of rebuilding trust, the story unfolds around themes of forgiveness, the complex nature of chosen family, and the ways food and shared spaces can offer healing.

9780593654828,Ours,,"Magic and liberation collide in this extraordinary debut that follows a conjurer known as Saint, who wields supernatural forces to destroy slave plantations throughout 1830s Arkansas. The freed souls she rescues find refuge in a hidden settlement called Ours, shielded from the outside world by Saint's mystical abilities.

This sanctuary represents more than escape—it becomes a bold experiment in Black autonomy, where former captives can build lives free from white supremacy's reach. Yet paradise proves fragile. Saint's powers begin to wane, her mind fractures under the weight of traumatic memories, and the town's protective barriers start to crumble.

Strangers with their own supernatural gifts breach the community's defenses, forcing residents to confront uncomfortable truths. Some begin questioning whether their isolation, however well-intentioned, has simply traded physical chains for invisible ones. Williams weaves four decades of this community's evolution into a rich tapestry that draws from African American folklore, spiritual traditions, and surrealist storytelling. The result examines how the pursuit of safety can sometimes conflict with true liberation, and whether any sanctuary—no matter how magical—can fully heal the wounds of systemic oppression.","Saint, a powerful conjurer, creates a magical sanctuary for formerly enslaved people in 1830s America.

Twin sisters inherit wealth built on industrial destruction and face a reckoning with their family's legacy. A young man clings to boarding school fantasies rather than confront adult realities. Even historical figures like George Gurdjieff appear as restless spirits, unable to find peace.

Williams creates a landscape where fairy tale elements—like Baba Yaga's chicken-legged hut—exist alongside contemporary anxieties about climate change and human disconnection. Her characters inhabit spaces between the real and surreal, often discovering uncomfortable truths about themselves and the damaged world they've inherited.

Cast perpetually in minor, stereotypical roles, he navigates a world that refuses to see him as fully human. His days unfold in a Chinatown restaurant that doubles as a soundstage, where he serves as background scenery in someone else's story.

Willis harbors ambitions beyond his current station, yet the roles available to him seem predetermined by others' limited imagination. His trajectory shifts dramatically through an unexpected moment of visibility that propels him beyond the confines he's known. This catalyst becomes the key to unlocking mysteries about his community's past and his own lineage.

Yu constructs a brilliant meta-commentary on representation and belonging, using the framework of television tropes to examine how society categorizes and diminishes certain voices. The novel interrogates questions of identity and agency while revealing the rich, complex histories that stereotypes work to obscure. Through Willis's journey from the margins toward center stage, Yu crafts both a sharp cultural critique and a deeply moving family saga.","Willis Wu lives as Generic Asian Man in a perpetual cop show production, dreaming of better roles while uncovering his family's buried history.

Their uncanny physical resemblance sparks a family conviction that goes beyond mere genetics: Eniiyi embodies Monife's spirit returned to earth. This belief carries ominous implications, suggesting the newborn is destined to repeat her predecessor's tragic trajectory.

Generations of Falodun women have wrestled with an inherited burden—a curse that sabotages every attempt at lasting love, leaving mothers, daughters, and grandmothers to share the same household in various stages of romantic disappointment. The family's spiritual baggage weighs heavily on each new generation.

Eniiyi's rescue of a drowning young man unexpectedly ignites romance, forcing her to confront the weight of family mythology.

Four decades later, each family member carries the weight of that trauma differently. Carl searches for meaning in what happened to him, while his wife Ruth vigilantly guards against further emotional damage. Their adult children have each found their own ways to cope with inherited fear and guilt—some through avoidance, others through self-destruction, and still others through denial.

Just as they're barely managing to function as a family, they face a devastating revelation: the wealth that both cursed and protected them is gone. Suddenly forced to examine who they are without their financial safety net, the Fletchers must untangle decades of damage and discover whether their bonds run deeper than their bank account.

Bora Chung crafts scenarios where technology and human nature collide in unexpected ways, revealing the absurdities lurking beneath our aspirations for progress.

These stories inhabit worlds where surveillance reaches into our sleeping minds and diseases manifest as disturbing social behaviors.

Clara thrives in London's literary scene, her success masking deeper wounds, while her sister Dempsey has retreated from the world entirely. The sisters share little beyond their origin story—abandoned as babies when their mother disappeared.

Everything shifts when Clara spots a familiar face on a crowded street. The woman bears an uncanny resemblance to the mother they lost, yet she appears untouched by time and unburdened by motherhood. This mysterious figure embodies the life their mother might have lived if she had never had children at all.

As Clara draws this stranger closer, convinced of her identity, Dempsey remains skeptical, sensing deception beneath the surface. The divide between the sisters deepens into something dangerous as they grapple with fundamental questions about maternal love, personal freedom, and the price of self-determination.

Agnes Lee has spent her life crafting beloved children's literature while fiercely protecting Fellowship Point, a stunning stretch of Maine coastline that has shaped her identity. Now she's racing against time to preserve this sacred place by transferring it to a conservation trust—but she needs her dearest friend's cooperation to make it happen.

Polly Wister has chosen a quieter path, building her world around her academic husband and three grown sons. She's always been the peacemaker, the one who smooths rough edges and maintains harmony. But Agnes's conservation plan threatens to fracture Polly's family, forcing her to choose between competing loyalties and confront what she truly values.

The delicate balance shifts further when ambitious young editor Maud Silver appears, intent on persuading Agnes to reveal her life story. As the past resurfaces, long-held secrets emerge that could reshape everything these women thought they knew about friendship, sacrifice, and the weight of choices made across a lifetime.

The promise of American opportunity crumbles under the weight of economic collapse, natural disasters, and the grinding reality of being outsiders in a system designed to exclude them.

Trelawny finds himself caught between his family's expectations and his own desperate need for independence. His journey from homelessness to precarious stability unfolds through a series of absurd employment adventures that reveal both the comedy and cruelty of trying to build a life from nothing. His brother Delano makes increasingly reckless choices in pursuit of quick money and custody of his children, while their cousin Cukie chases the ghost of an absent father.

Escoffery crafts a portrait of displacement that refuses easy answers about identity and belonging. These characters exist in the margins—too foreign for America, too changed for Jamaica—navigating a landscape where survival requires constant reinvention. The collection balances sharp social observation with moments of unexpected tenderness, examining how families fracture and heal under pressure while maintaining their essential bonds.","Linked stories follow a Jamaican family navigating racism, financial disaster, and the American dream in Miami.

What makes Cassie's situation truly surreal is her oldest friend: a tiny black hole that has shadowed her since childhood. This gravitational anomaly responds to her emotional state, expanding when her mental health deteriorates and contracting during better moments. It's both observer and threat, patiently waiting as Cassie's world grows increasingly unstable.

An unexpected pregnancy arrives just as her boss begins demanding she participate in potentially criminal activities.

The cocaine arrest throws his carefully constructed identity into chaos—his Stanford education and professional prospects colliding violently with the harsh realities of the criminal justice system.

The timing couldn't be worse. Elle, his closest friend and roommate, has just died under circumstances that left more questions than answers. The media circus surrounding her famous singer father only amplified Smith's grief and confusion about who Elle really was beneath their intimate friendship.

Fleeing to Atlanta offers no refuge. His family's expectations—generations of accomplished doctors and lawyers—feel suffocating as Smith grapples with his unraveling life. Yet returning to New York proves equally treacherous, as he's drawn back into the very underground networks that led to his downfall.

Franklin crafts a story that moves between recovery meetings and police interrogations, Atlanta's elite social circles and New York's shadowy nightlife. This is a novel about the exhausting work of existing between identities—educated but criminalized, privileged yet vulnerable—and the search for authentic connection in a world determined to categorize and judge.","Smith's arrest for cocaine possession sends him spiraling between worlds—his Stanford pedigree and dangerous reality, his dead roommate's secrets and his own unraveling.

Katharina Kepler has spent her life mixing herbal remedies and speaking her mind freely—perhaps too freely for the comfort of her neighbors in the small town of Leonberg.

Her world turns upside down when a disturbed local woman claims Katharina poisoned her with a mysterious concoction. As war ravages the countryside and plague spreads terror through the Holy Roman Empire, the community's paranoia finds its perfect target. Even having Johannes Kepler—the celebrated Imperial Mathematician who mapped the movements of planets—as a son cannot shield her from the growing hysteria.

Facing torture and execution, Katharina recounts her version of events to Simon, a secretive neighbor who becomes her unlikely confidant. Through her voice, Rivka Galchen weaves a story that exposes how quickly fear can transform ordinary people into a dangerous mob. Based on actual historical records, this darkly humorous tale reveals the devastating collision between superstition and power, creating a mirror for our own times when rumors can destroy lives and communities turn against their most vulnerable members.","When Katharina Kepler—mother of the famous astronomer—is accused of witchcraft in 17th-century Germany, her survival depends on wit and resilience.

Thirteen years earlier, promising artist Anita de Monte died under circumstances that quickly faded from public memory. As Raquel uncovers Anita's buried story, disturbing parallels emerge between their experiences navigating prestigious institutions and complicated relationships with powerful men.

Gonzalez constructs a dual narrative that interrogates how class, race, and gender determine whose stories survive and whose disappear. The novel examines the seductive pull of acceptance into exclusive circles and the hidden costs of that belonging. Through both women's journeys, it reveals how systems of privilege protect some while rendering others invisible, asking whether breaking these patterns is possible—or if history is doomed to repeat itself in new forms.","Two women, decades apart, navigate the treacherous waters of art world elites and dangerous relationships.

Yet for all her skill at orchestrating perfect celebrations, Olga struggles to navigate her own relationships and identity. The siblings have built successful public personas, but their foundation remains shaky—rooted in abandonment by their activist mother Blanca, who chose political revolution over raising her children.

Their carefully constructed lives face disruption from two forces: Matteo, a new love interest who challenges Olga to examine buried truths, and the unexpected return of their mother. As Hurricane Maria approaches, the storm becomes both literal threat and metaphor for the upheaval threatening to expose family secrets and political corruption.

Gonzalez crafts a story that moves between wedding venues and community meetings, examining how personal ambition intersects with cultural identity. The novel interrogates the price of assimilation and success, questioning whether the American dream requires abandoning one's roots.

Stripped of everything familiar, Marguerite finds solace in an unexpected romance with her guardian's servant. Their forbidden love becomes a lifeline in her isolation—until it's discovered. The punishment is swift and merciless: exile to a barren island where death seems inevitable.

From silk gowns to animal skins, from drawing rooms to makeshift shelters, Marguerite must shed every trace of her former self. Winter approaches with ruthless certainty, bringing temperatures that can kill and challenges that test the limits of human endurance.

The state's volatile climate mirrors the emotional turbulence of its inhabitants—people caught between what they've lost and what they're desperately trying to hold onto.

Groff populates this unstable terrain with characters whose lives intersect across time and geography: sisters learning to survive on their own terms, couples grappling with unfulfilled dreams, individuals seeking connection in a landscape that seems designed to isolate. Each story operates like a pressure cooker, building tension until the inevitable release—sometimes violent, sometimes tender, always transformative.

The real power lies in how these narratives capture the precarious nature of modern life, where external dangers pale beside the internal storms we weather daily. Through her unflinching examination of family dynamics, desire, and survival, Groff reveals how people adapt—or fail to adapt—when everything familiar begins to shift beneath their feet.","Eleven fierce stories of mothers, storms, snakes, and heat forge a portrait of a state alive with dread and radiance.

Avram carries his own scars—a former artist shattered by capture and torture, now reluctant to engage with the world. Yet as they traverse the landscape together, Ora's relentless storytelling begins to resurrect not only her absent son but something within Avram as well. Through her memories of raising Ofer, she creates a vivid tapestry of ordinary moments made precious by their fragility.

9780316261357,Imagine Me Gone,,"In 1960s London, Margaret makes a fateful decision to marry John despite his hospitalization for depression, setting in motion a multigenerational reckoning with mental illness. Their eldest son Michael emerges as the family's most vulnerable member—a music-obsessed intellectual whose razor-sharp humor masks deepening psychological fragility inherited from his father.

As Michael's condition deteriorates, his siblings Celia and Alec find themselves drawn into an exhausting cycle of vigilance and care. Each family member grapples differently with the weight of loving someone whose mind works against him, creating a complex web of guilt, responsibility, and fierce protectiveness.

Haslett constructs this intimate family drama through five distinct voices, revealing how depression ripples outward to touch every relationship and decision. The novel examines the impossible mathematics of sacrifice—how much can one family give before love becomes a form of slow destruction? Through Michael's brilliant, fragmented perspective and his family's unwavering commitment, the story illuminates both the devastating inheritance of mental illness and the stubborn persistence of human connection in the face of seemingly insurmountable pain.","From a Pulitzer finalist, a devastating family saga about inherited depression and unconditional love. Told through five voices across decades, following a brilliant son's mental illness and his family's fierce devotion.",368,,Fiction / LGBTQ+ / Gay,"Little, Brown and Company",03/05/2016,Adam Haslett,"Adam Haslett wrote You Are Not a Stranger Here, Union Atlantic, and Imagine Me Gone, earning Pulitzer Prize finalist recognition twice.

But Haslett really shows his chops channeling [oldest son] Michael's amped-up voice . . . I got caught up in the beauty of Haslett's sentences and the lives of these oh-so-human people bound by shared duress and cycles of hope. Haslett's signature achievement in Imagine Me Gone is to temper the harrowing with the humorous while keeping a steady bead on the pathos. You want sympathetic characters? You want a narrative that showcases love as a many-splendored thing capacious enough to encompass stalwart, long-suffering spouses, loyal siblings, suffocatingly obsessive crushes, and casual, noncommittal relationships (both gay and straight) that morph as if by magic into soul-sustenance? You want writing that thrums with anguish and compassion? It's all here.""

—Heller McAlpin, NPR

""The family Adam Haslett has created in Imagine Me Gone feels as true and as complex as our own actual families are, and lays nearly as deep a claim upon our love and loyalty.

The magic of childhood gives way to the brutal realities of war and political upheaval.

Their employer's financial ruin threatens everything until a business opportunity emerges: marketing Miss Mamie's exceptional rib sauce using August's image as a demeaning mascot.

The cruel irony cuts deep—while the white family stands to recover their wealth, the very people whose labor and creativity fuel this venture receive nothing. August watches his dignity stripped away, transformed into a grotesque caricature for commercial gain. As humiliation festers into fury, the psychological toll becomes unbearable.

Hubbard constructs a devastating portrait of exploitation disguised as opportunity, examining how America has long profited from Black talent while denying Black humanity. The novel interrogates the violence inherent in racial caricature and the crushing weight of systemic dehumanization. Through August's mounting desperation, readers witness the human cost of treating people as commodities, building toward consequences that feel both inevitable and tragic.","When a white family's fortune crumbles, they exploit their Black servants' talents for profit, using a degrading caricature without compensation.

The centerpiece novella thrusts readers into chaos as white supremacist violence erupts in Charlottesville. A young Black woman who carries the DNA of both Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings must lead her neighbors to safety—finding shelter in the very plantation where her ancestors lived as enslaved people. The irony cuts deep: seeking sanctuary in a monument to the oppression that still threatens to destroy them.

Elsewhere, a father turns his infant son into an unwitting subject of racial experimentation, documenting every moment to prove that prejudice is learned, not innate. Other stories follow characters grappling with displacement and identity—immigrants searching for belonging, mixed-race individuals crafting new selves, mothers preparing for catastrophe while clinging to hope.

The old patriarch has orchestrated one final power play: an elaborate inheritance challenge that traps the fractured Storm family together for seven days. Alice finds herself navigating not just her own complicated feelings about returning home, but the explosive dynamics of siblings who've grown into strangers.

9780805096606,The Mirror & the Light,,"Thomas Cromwell stands at the pinnacle of Tudor power, having survived the bloody spectacle of Anne Boleyn's execution to become Henry VIII's most trusted advisor. Yet for all his influence, this blacksmith's son from Putney remains fundamentally alone—dependent solely on his cunning and adaptability in a court where loyalty shifts like quicksand.

As Henry grows increasingly erratic and England faces mounting threats from within and abroad, Cromwell finds himself walking an ever-narrower path between survival and destruction. His vision of a transformed England—modern, unified, freed from the weight of its medieval past—drives him forward even as the ground beneath his feet grows treacherous.

Mantel's concluding volume examines the price of ambition and the impossibility of escaping history's long shadow. Through Cromwell's final chapter, she illuminates the eternal struggle between individual will and the forces that ultimately consume even the most brilliant political minds. The result is a meditation on power, mortality, and the question of whether any person—however gifted—can truly reshape the world without being destroyed by it.","The final volume in Mantel's Cromwell trilogy traces his rise to unparalleled power and his brutal fall.

The streets become a canvas for remembrance as she confronts the reality of loss: back home, the family house awaits new owners, its rooms already emptied of a lifetime's accumulation.

Memories surface with each step—her mother's razor-sharp humor, her boundless capacity for giving, her stubborn refusal to yield to physical frailty. Yet beneath these recollections lies a more troubling question: what right does a writer have to transform private pain into public art?

McCracken weaves together themes of inheritance and imagination, asking whether love justifies exposure, whether stories heal or exploit. The result transcends simple mourning to become an inquiry into the very nature of creation itself. Through prose that shifts between laughter and sorrow, she reveals how artists must navigate the treacherous territory between honoring the dead and honoring their secrets. This is literature as archaeology—digging through the layers of relationship to uncover what endures when everything else crumbles.","A writer mourning her mother's death takes a trip to London and grapples with memory, grief, and the ethics of storytelling.

Then Jane steps onto her subway car—leather jacket, vintage style, and a smile that makes August question everything she thought she knew about love at first sight. What starts as stolen glances during daily commutes grows into something deeper, until August discovers the impossible truth: Jane isn't just dressed like she stepped out of the 1970s punk scene. She's actually been trapped on this subway line for decades, caught in a temporal loop that defies explanation.

Suddenly August faces a choice that terrifies her—embrace the very magic she's spent years denying, or lose the person who's shown her that some things are worth believing in. With help from her eccentric roommates and a crash course in time-bending romance, August must decide whether love is powerful enough to transcend both time and her own fears.","August's cynical worldview crumbles when she falls for Jane, a mysterious girl on the subway who turns out to be displaced from the 1970s.

The collection moves through different perspectives and ages, from adolescents grappling with sudden loss to adults whose past traumas resurface in unexpected ways. A young person questions religious expectations while facing accusations of spiritual rebellion. Siblings embark on a journey carrying their father's remains, discovering how his influence persists even in death.

Jason Mott constructs a literary funhouse where the impossible becomes inevitable—peacocks materialize from thin air, sea creatures breach reality's surface, and time bends like light through a prism.

One author circles the globe, clutching a prestigious award while grappling with success's hollow weight. Meanwhile, his counterpart faces a different kind of spotlight: addressing students whose innocence was shattered by bullets. Their parallel journeys spiral toward each other through a maze of absurdist encounters and heartbreaking truths.

Mott refuses to choose between comedy and tragedy, instead forging something fiercer. His characters inhabit a universe where grief and laughter occupy the same breath, where surreal imagery serves as both shield and sword against an incomprehensible world. The result challenges readers to find meaning in chaos, hope in devastation, and connection across seemingly impossible distances. This is storytelling that risks everything—sanity, convention, easy answers—in pursuit of something more essential than comfort.","Two Black writers seek peace in a world torn by gun violence—one on a global book tour, another speaking at a school after a shooting.

She arrives from America carrying the weight of inherited nostalgia, seeking connection to an Egypt that exists more in imagination than memory. He carries a camera that once documented revolution, now silent witness to his own unraveling.

Their attraction ignites quickly, fed by mutual fascination and the intoxicating possibility of transformation through the other. Yet beneath the surface romance lurks something more complex—questions of privilege, displacement, and the stories we tell ourselves about belonging. As their relationship intensifies, the line between love and exploitation blurs, revealing uncomfortable truths about power, desire, and the price of seeking authenticity in someone else's struggle.

Through shifting viewpoints, this debut interrogates the mythology of homeland and the violence that can emerge when people become symbols rather than individuals. It asks difficult questions about who owns suffering, who profits from revolution's aftermath, and what happens when the personal becomes political in the most intimate spaces.","Post-revolution Cairo becomes the backdrop for a toxic romance between an Egyptian American woman and a local photographer.

Saunders crafts scenarios both fantastical and eerily familiar: an elderly man whose memories have been deliberately erased for political gain, a grandfather writing to his grandson from a climate-ravaged future, two women confronting their shared past during a violent storm.

Each story functions as a moral experiment, testing characters against systems designed to exploit or diminish them. A worker at a macabre theme park begins to see through the illusions that have shaped his existence. Dreams deferred reveal their true cost in a brief but shattering meditation on what we sacrifice for security.

Her adoptive father struggles to make ends meet as an editor while her Boston blue-blood mother fights to keep their unconventional family afloat. Dylan, her adoptive brother, seems destined for success in an increasingly fractured America, while Vera—caught between her Jewish and Korean heritage—searches for her place in a world that feels perpetually unstable.

Armed with an ever-growing vocabulary and an observant nature that captures both the absurd and heartbreaking details of daily life, Vera harbors three essential wishes. She dreams of finding genuine friendship at school, preventing her parents' marriage from dissolving, and most importantly, meeting her birth mother—the woman she believes holds the key to understanding her identity.

Shteyngart crafts a story that balances sharp social commentary with the innocent wisdom of childhood perspective. Through Vera's eyes, readers witness both intimate family dynamics and the broader cultural anxieties of contemporary America, creating a narrative that finds humor and hope even amid uncertainty.","Ten-year-old Vera navigates her family's unraveling against the backdrop of America's own collapse.

The irony isn't lost on her: she wasn't certain she wanted children, yet the loss leaves her feeling like she's failed at something fundamental.

Christine Smallwood crafts a razor-sharp examination of contemporary disappointment, where professional stagnation meets personal upheaval. Dorothy's story captures the particular anguish of educated millennials caught between their expectations and reality, where even the pursuit of knowledge feels hollow. This debut novel dissects the gap between how we imagine our lives should unfold and the messy, uncertain ways they actually do.

These characters exist in the spaces between tradition and rebellion, memory and forgetting, where family obligations clash with personal desires.

The collection introduces us to a former athlete whose midlife crisis plays out on the badminton court, siblings whose wedding celebration becomes an opportunity for family revenge, and lovers whose relationship unfolds against the backdrop of Silicon Valley ambition and literary obsession. Each story captures the particular experience of growing up in the shadow of genocide while navigating thoroughly contemporary concerns about identity, sexuality, and belonging.

So masterfully balances comedy with heartbreak, revealing how humor becomes both shield and weapon for a community still processing collective trauma. These characters are neither tragic nor triumphant—they're beautifully, messily human, struggling with the same universal questions of love and purpose while carrying the specific weight of their inherited history.","Children of Cambodian refugees navigate identity, trauma, and belonging in California's Central Valley.

Dr. Menka stumbles upon evidence that body parts from his hospital are being harvested for dark purposes, a discovery he shares with his charismatic friend Duyole Pitan-Payne.

Duyole embodies everything his society values—engineering brilliance, royal bloodlines, and magnetic charm that makes him the center of any gathering. His appointment to a coveted UN position in New York should be the crowning achievement of his career. Instead, mysterious forces mobilize to block his path, launching attacks whose origins and motivations remain hidden.

Soyinka constructs a narrative that operates on multiple levels simultaneously. The investigation into the body-snatching scheme becomes a vehicle for exposing the rot that permeates every institution. What begins as a medical scandal expands into an examination of how corruption transforms entire societies, turning sacred spaces into marketplaces and reducing human dignity to commodity pricing.

Her life has unfolded predictably—decent job, comfortable apartment, steady friendships—yet something fundamental feels absent. Her father's declining health casts a shadow over this milestone, reminding her of time's relentless passage.

Then the impossible happens: she awakens as her teenage self in 1996, inhabiting her sixteen-year-old body with four decades of accumulated wisdom. The disorientation of adolescence pales beside the gift of encountering her father as he once was—vibrant, healthy, and full of the energy that illness has stolen.

This unexpected reunion forces Alice to reconsider everything she thought she understood about their relationship and her own choices. Armed with hindsight's clarity, she begins to question whether the path she took was inevitable or simply one possibility among many. Straub crafts a meditation on family bonds and the weight of regret, asking whether knowledge of the future is blessing or burden. The result is a story that uses fantastical premises to examine deeply human truths about love, loss, and the courage required to accept both.","When Alice wakes up on her fortieth birthday, she's somehow sixteen again—and reunited with her younger, healthier father.

Hugh ""Shuggie"" Bain exists in the space between childhood and premature responsibility, watching over a mother whose beauty masks a devastating relationship with alcohol.

Agnes Bain clings to dignity through carefully applied makeup and dreams of respectability, even as economic collapse strips away the foundations of her world. Her son becomes her unlikely anchor, the one person who refuses to abandon her when sobriety gives way to binges that drain their meager resources. Their bond transcends typical family dynamics—part caretaker and patient, part conspirators against a harsh reality.

Meanwhile, Shuggie grapples with his own identity in a community that demands conformity. His difference sets him apart in ways that adults recognize but he cannot yet name, adding another layer of isolation to his already complicated existence. The novel examines how economic devastation ripples through generations, and how the fierce loyalty between parent and child can become both a lifeline and a trap that shapes the trajectory of young lives.","Young Shuggie navigates 1980s Glasgow while caring for his glamorous, alcoholic mother Agnes.

These narratives center on characters caught between honoring their heritage and confronting the realities of modern reservation existence.

The collection moves through a landscape where ancient curses emerge from buried jars, friends stumble through drug deals gone wrong in frozen forests, and elders with fading memories blur past and present. Talty introduces us to characters plotting museum heists inspired by television shows, families wrestling with generational trauma, and individuals searching for meaning amid loss.

What emerges is a portrait of resilience that refuses easy answers or romantic notions about Indigenous experience. Talty's voice cuts through sentiment to reveal the complex ways people adapt, endure, and sometimes transcend their circumstances. The stories examine how identity gets shaped by both choice and circumstance, exploring the tension between tradition and survival in a community where both matter deeply.

This debut collection establishes Talty as an essential voice in contemporary literature, offering readers an authentic window into a world rarely seen with such nuance and honesty.","Twelve stories set in a Penobscot community in Maine, where families navigate painful histories and uncertain futures.

But as I got deeper into the work, into the book, and came to understand these lives and this community, the further away it felt from my initial comparison with Johnson, and the more familiar it felt—our Native communities being bound by countless common threads, strengths and afflictions both—and only then did I understand the distinct brilliance of Talty's voice as its own, and ours. I knew and felt for these people. Wanted to and knew I couldn't help them, even as they did me. There is so much brutal, raw, and beautiful power in these stories. I kept wanting to read and know more about these peoples' lives, how they ended up where they ended up, how they would get out, how they wouldn't.

Hiruko, now stateless, creates her own hybrid tongue called Panska to communicate with fellow displaced children in Denmark, cobbling together fragments from multiple languages because her mind can no longer contain them all.

Driven by an urgent need to find others who remember her native language, she assembles an eccentric group of travelers. Their quest becomes a picaresque adventure through a transformed Europe, where they encounter cooking contests centered on umami, deceased marine life, dangerous extremists, robotic companions, and Spanish bullfighters.

Tawada constructs a world both absurd and achingly real, where climate displacement has reshuffled human civilization. The narrative unfolds through a series of dreamlike episodes that feel simultaneously whimsical and urgent. Each encounter reveals something profound about belonging, communication, and survival in a world where entire cultures can simply disappear.

The irony isn't lost on her—this brilliant woman who observes everything, understands more than anyone realizes, yet remains invisible to those she serves.

The salon buzzes with unspoken tensions. Her coworkers carry their own stories of survival and adaptation, sharing whispered conversations that reveal dreams deferred and compromises made.

9781668034347,The Safekeep,,"Isabel has built her solitary existence around order and control, finding comfort in the predictable rhythms of her inherited home in postwar Netherlands. This carefully constructed world fractures when her brother deposits Eva—a woman who embodies everything Isabel despises about carelessness and chaos—on her doorstep for an extended stay.

The collision between Isabel's rigid expectations and Eva's disruptive presence creates an electric tension that permeates every corner of the house. As household objects begin vanishing and Isabel's surveillance of her unwelcome guest intensifies, the boundary between suspicion and fascination dissolves entirely.

What emerges is a psychological excavation that reaches far beyond personal animosity. The summer heat becomes a catalyst for revelations that challenge everything Isabel believed about her family's past and her own identity. Van der Wouden constructs a narrative that interrogates how we inherit trauma, how desire can emerge from antagonism, and how the stories we tell ourselves about history often conceal the most essential truths.

9781982104498,Let Us Descend,,"Annis faces an unthinkable betrayal: sold into bondage by her own father, she must endure the treacherous passage from Carolina's coastal plantations to Louisiana's merciless sugar fields. The physical journey becomes a spiritual odyssey as she draws strength from ancestral memories—her mother's wisdom and tales of a fierce African grandmother who wielded both blade and magic.

Surrounded by cruelty, Annis discovers she can access realms where ancestors dwell and elemental forces hold sway. These supernatural encounters offer both solace and danger, as not every spirit wishes her well. The American landscape itself becomes a character—swamplands and rivers bearing witness to generations of trauma while harboring ancient powers that refuse to be silenced.

Ward crafts a narrative where mythology intersects with historical horror, showing how one young woman's refusal to surrender her inner life becomes an act of resistance. Through Annis's eyes, we witness not just the machinery of oppression, but the indestructible human capacity to forge meaning from suffering and find pathways to spiritual liberation even within physical bondage.","Ward follows an enslaved girl's journey from Carolina rice fields to Louisiana sugar plantations, weaving African spirituality through American brutality.

In small-town Tennessee, two teenage outcasts discover each other during what promises to be another suffocating summer. Frankie, a would-be writer drifting through high school, finds kinship with Zeke, a gifted artist nursing his own wounds. Their collaboration births something unexpected: cryptic posters bearing a single, haunting message that begins appearing throughout their conservative town.

But the past refuses to stay hidden when a persistent journalist begins investigating the events that once turned her hometown upside down. Now she must decide whether to protect the life she's constructed or confront the truth about that transformative summer.

The unconventional upbringing that once defined them now seems to sabotage any attempt at normalcy. Their return coincides with their parents' announcement of an ambitious final project that threatens to pull the family back into familiar patterns.
