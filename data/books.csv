9781984801197,A Little Devil in America,A Little Devil in America,Notes in Praise of Black Performance,Abdurraqib,Hanif,Hanif Abdurraqib,,, ,30/03/2021,2021,Random House,,NF,SOC,SOC001000,Social Science / Cultural & Ethnic Studies / American / African American & Black Studies,36,,Hardcover,320,"A kaleidoscopic essay collection celebrating Black performance—from dance and music to everyday rituals—as a lens on American history and personal memory. Abdurraqib blends criticism, reportage, and memoir with signature warmth and insight.","""I was a devil in other countries, and I was a little devil in America, too."" Inspired by these words from Josephine Baker at the 1963 March on Washington, MacArthur Fellow Hanif Abdurraqib has crafted a profound reflection on how Black performance shapes American culture.

Each moment he examines—whether it's Merry Clayton's twenty-seven seconds wailing ""rape, murder"" in ""Gimme Shelter,"" a schoolyard fight, a dance marathon, or that instant in spades right after cards are dealt—carries layers of meaning across Black and white cultures, American politics, and Abdurraqib's own history of love, grief, and performance.

Touching on Michael Jackson, Patti LaBelle, Billy Dee Williams, Wu-Tang Clan, and Dave Chappelle, Abdurraqib writes with jubilation and pain. He explains the poignancy of performances both big and small, each feeling intensely familiar yet urgent. Sharp, humorous, and heartfelt, A Little Devil in America celebrates Black performance across time and space—from midcentury Paris to the moon, and back to a cramped Columbus living room.","Hanif Abdurraqib weaves together Michael Jackson, Patti LaBelle, and Dave Chappelle in this stunning meditation on Black performance and American culture. Perfect for readers who were moved by Between the World and Me or loved The 1619 Project.","Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, essayist, and cultural critic from Columbus, Ohio, and recipient of a MacArthur Foundation ""Genius"" grant.

—Brit Bennett, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Vanishing Half

""Poignant . . . Abdurraqib has written an important book on the transformative power of . . . love.""

—The New York Times

""Hanif Abdurraqib's genius is in pinpointing those moments in American cultural history when Black people made lightning strike. But Black performance, Black artistry, Black freedom too often came at devastating price. The real devil in America is America itself, the one who stole the soul that he, through open eyes and with fearless prose, snatches back. This is searing, revelatory, filled with utter heartbreak, and unstoppable joy.""

—Marlon James, author of Black Leopard, Red Wolf","A sweeping, genre-bending “masterpiece” (Minneapolis Star Tribune) exploring Black art, music, and culture in all their glory and complexity—from Soul Train, Aretha Franklin, and James Brown to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Whitney Houston, and Beyoncé.","“I was a devil in other countries, and I was a little devil in America, too.” Inspired by these few words, spoken by Josephine Baker at the 1963 March on Washington, MacArthur “Genius Grant” Fellow and bestselling author Hanif Abdurraqib has written a profound and lasting reflection on how Black performance is inextricably woven into the fabric of American culture. Each moment in every performance he examines—whether it’s the twenty-seven seconds in “Gimme Shelter” in which Merry Clayton wails the words “rape, murder,” a schoolyard fistfight, a dance marathon, or the instant in a game of spades right after the cards are dealt—has layers of resonance in Black and white cultures, the politics of American empire, and Abdurraqib’s own personal history of love, grief, and performance.

Touching on Michael Jackson, Patti LaBelle, Billy Dee Williams, the Wu-Tan Clan, Dave Chappelle, and more, Abdurraqib writes prose brimming with jubilation and pain. With care and generosity, he explains the poignancy of performances big and small, each one feeling intensely familiar and vital, both timeless and desperately urgent. Filled with sharp insight, humor, and heart, A Little Devil in America exalts the Black performance that unfolds in specific moments in time and space—from midcentury Paris to the moon, and back down again to a cramped living room in Columbus, Ohio.","Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, essayist, and cultural critic from Columbus, Ohio, and the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “Genius” grant. His most recent book, A Little Devil in America, was the winner of the Carnegie Medal and the Gordon Burns Prize and a finalist for the National Book Award.

His search leads him toward an uncle who rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the angel of death, offering comfort to the dying. But it's a painting discovered in a Brooklyn art gallery that changes everything, suggesting his mother may not have been who she seemed.

Iran boasted the world's fifth largest army, billions in oil revenues, and a booming capital dotted with construction cranes. The regime's feared secret police had crushed communist opposition while buying off conservative Muslim clergy. The Shah seemed both invulnerable and invaluable as a Cold War ally.

Fourteen months later, he fled into exile, overthrown by a volcanic religious revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini. The ensuing hostage crisis forever damaged America's global standing. How could the United States—with one of its largest CIA stations and thousands of military personnel in Iran—have been so catastrophically blind?

Scott Anderson weaves a spellbinding tale of a dictator oblivious to his subjects' disdain and a superpower stumbling toward disaster. With the same narrative brilliance that made Lawrence in Arabia essential reading, Anderson argues that the Iranian Revolution ranks with the French and Russian revolutions in world-shattering impact, creating a template for religious nationalism that continues to fuel global upheaval today.","The Iranian Revolution changed everything, yet America never saw it coming. Scott Anderson exposes the spectacular intelligence failures that toppled the Shah and birthed modern religious nationalism. Essential reading for understanding today's fractured world.","Scott Anderson is the author of two novels and five works of nonfiction, including the international bestseller Lawrence in Arabia, a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and New York Times Notable Book.

Scrupulous and enterprising reporting rarely combine with such superb storytelling.""

—The Washington Post","From the author of the landmark bestseller Lawrence in Arabia comes a stunningly revelatory narrative history of the Iranian Revolution, one of the most momentous events in modern times. This groundbreaking work exposes the jaw-dropping stupidity of the American government and traces the rise of religious nationalism, offering essential insights into today's global unrest.","On New Year’s Eve, 1977, on a state visit to Iran, President Jimmy Carter toasted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, King of Kings, Light of the Aryans, Shadow of God on Earth, praising Iran as “an island of stability “ due to “your leadership and the respect and admiration and love which your people give to you.” Iran had the world’s fifth largest army and was awash in billions of dollars in oil revenues.  Construction cranes dotted the skyline of its booming capital, Tehran.  The regime’s feared secret police force SAVAK had crushed communist opposition, and the Shah had bought off the conservative Muslim clergy inside the country.  He seemed invulnerable, and invaluable to the United States as an ally in the Cold War.  Fourteen months later the Shah fled Iran into exile, forced from the throne by a volcanic religious revolution led by a fiery cleric named Ayatollah Khomeini. The ensuing hostage crisis forever damaged America’s standing in the world.  How could the United States, which had one of the largest CIA stations in the world and thousands of military personnel in Iran, have been so blind?

The spellbinding story Scott Anderson weaves is one of a dictator blind to the disdain of his subjects and a superpower blundering into disaster. Scott Anderson tells this astonishing tale with the narrative brio, mordant wit, and keen analysis that made his bestselling Lawrence of Arabia one of the key texts in understanding the modern Middle East.  The Iranian Revolution, Anderson convincingly argues, was as world-shattering an event as the French and Russian revolutions.  In the Middle East, in India, in Southeast Asia, in Europe, and now in the United States, the hatred of economically-marginalized, religiously-fervent masses for a wealthy secular elite has led to violence and upheaval – and Iran was the template.  King of Kings is a bravura work of history, and a warning.","Scott Anderson is the author of two novels and five works of nonfiction, including Lawrence of Arabia, an international bestseller which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and a New York Times Notable Book. He is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine. The New York Times Magazine devoted an entire issue to his reportage across the Middle East in August 2016, which was published in book form as Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart.","“[A] masterly new account of the Iranian revolution, illustrates the stubborn American blindness that hastened the shah’s demise and helped the mullahs prevail.

Lushly written, it balances heartbreak with defiance, intimacy with epic scope.","They call themselves the Stolen. Their owners call them captives. They are taught their captors' tongues and beliefs, but they have a language and rituals all their own.

At Placid Hall, a plantation in the American South, Cato and William endure the whims of their tyrannical captor, Cannonball Greene. They face inhumane physical toil, brutal beatings, and the constant threat of separation from loved ones. It's this cruel practice—the wanton destruction of love, the belief that Black people aren't capable of loving—that wounds them most deeply.

William, reserved and stubborn, falls for Margaret, a small but mighty woman with remarkable self-possession. Cato, still grieving his first love Iris who was sold without warning, finds solace in his close-knit group of friends: William, who is like a brother; Margaret; Little Zander; Milton, a gifted artist; and Pandora, whose beauty captivates him.

Their bonds begin to fray when a visiting minister with a mysterious past fills their heads with ideas about independence. He tells them that freedom means choosing everything—when to dine, when to work, whom and how to love. But in a landscape marked by deceit and uncertainty, who can they trust?

In this elegant work of monumental imagination, Jabari Asim presents a powerful novel that examines intimacy and longing while asking a vital question: What would happen if an enslaved person risked everything for love?","Love blooms in impossible circumstances as enslaved people at a brutal plantation navigate friendship, romance, and dreams of freedom.

—Kirkus","The Water Dancer meets The Prophets in this spare, gripping, and beautifully rendered novel exploring love and friendship among a group of enslaved Black strivers in the mid-19th century.","They call themselves the Stolen. Their owners call them captives. They are taught their captors’ tongues and their beliefs but they have a language and rituals all their own.

In a world that would be allegorical if it weren’t saturated in harsh truths, Cato and William meet at Placid Hall, a plantation in an unspecified part of the American South. Subject to the whims of their tyrannical and eccentric captor, Cannonball Greene, they never know what harm may befall them: inhumane physical toil in the plantation’s quarry by day, a beating by night, or the sale of a loved one at any moment. It’s that cruel practice—the wanton destruction of love, the belief that Black people aren’t even capable of loving—that hurts the most.

It hurts the reserved and stubborn William, who finds himself falling for Margaret, a small but mighty woman with self-possession beyond her years. And it hurts Cato, whose first love, Iris, was sold off with no forewarning. He now finds solace in his hearty band of friends, including William, who is like a brother; Margaret; Little Zander; and Milton, a gifted artist. There is also Pandora, with thick braids and long limbs, whose beauty calls to him.

Their relationships begin to fray when a visiting minister with a mysterious past starts to fill their heads with ideas about independence. He tells them that with freedom comes the right to choose the small things—when to dine, when to begin and end work—as well as the big things, such as whom and how to love. Do they follow the preacher and pursue the unknown? Confined in a landscape marked by deceit and uncertainty, who can they trust?

In an elegant work of monumental imagination that will reorient how we think of the legacy of America’s shameful past, Jabari Asim presents a beautiful, powerful, and elegiac novel that examines intimacy and longing in the quarters while asking a vital question: What would happen if an enslaved person risked everything for love?","Jabari Asim is a writer and multidisciplinary artist.

By the winter of 1777, the exhausted Continental Army could claim only that it had escaped annihilation by the world’s most formidable fighting force.

Two years into the war, George III is as determined as ever to bring his rebellious colonies to heel.

―Publishers Weekly",The magnificent conclusion to Rick Atkinson's acclaimed Liberation Trilogy about the Allied triumph in Europe during World War II.,"It is the twentieth century's unrivaled epic: at a staggering price, the United States and its allies liberated Europe and vanquished Hitler. In the first two volumes of his bestselling Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson recounted how the American-led coalition fought through North Africa and Italy to the threshold of victory. Now, in The Guns at Last Light, he tells the most dramatic story of all-the titanic battle for Western Europe.

D-Day marked the commencement of the final campaign of the European war, and Atkinson's riveting account of that bold gamble sets the pace for the masterly narrative that follows. The brutal fight in Normandy, the liberation of Paris, the disaster that was Operation Market Garden, the horrific Battle of the Bulge, and finally the thrust to the heart of the Third Reich-all these historic events and more come alive with a wealth of new material and a mesmerizing cast of characters. Atkinson tells the tale from the perspective of participants at every level, from presidents and generals to war-weary lieutenants and terrified teenage riflemen. When Germany at last surrenders, we understand anew both the devastating cost of this global conflagration and the enormous effort required to win the Allied victory.

With the stirring final volume of this monumental trilogy, Atkinson's accomplishment is manifest. He has produced the definitive chronicle of the war that unshackled a continent and preserved freedom in the West.","Rick Atkinson is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of eight narrative histories about five American wars, including The Long Gray Line, the Liberation Trilogy (An Army at Dawn, The Day of Battle, and The Guns at Last Light), and The British Are Coming, the first volume of the Revolution Trilogy.

""Aviv writes with an unpredictable mixture of intimacy and distance, exploring how psychiatric language often alters what it names.

She lives in Brooklyn, New York.","""In this penetrating, landmark book, Rachel Aviv investigates what she calls the 'psychic hinterlands,' drawing on her customary vivid reporting and her own extraordinary personal story to pose unsettling questions about the ways in which we reckon with mental illness by categorizing it, diagnosing it, giving it a name. Threading together the intimate and emotionally shattering stories of a series of very different people who have struggled to live with and to understand their own psychological afflictions, Aviv has created an arresting work of profound empathy and insight.""―Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Say Nothing and Empire of Pain

""Intimate and revelatory . . . attuned to subtlety and complexity . . . This isn't an anti-psychiatry book― Aviv is too aware of the specifics of any situation to succumb to anything so sweeping and polemical . . . a book-length demonstration of Aviv’s extraordinary ability to hold space for the 'uncertainty, mysteries and doubts' of others.""―Jennifer Szalai, New York Times

“Aviv writes with an unpredictable mixture of intimacy and distance, exploring how psychiatric language often alters what it names. She has assembled a remarkable archive of unpublished materials―memoirs, poems, journals (including her own)―that offers a visceral counterpoint to the official languages of institutions and expertise. I admire her rigor and eloquence but also her restraint―she makes vivid experiences we can’t explain.”―Ben Lerner, author of The Topeka School","Winner — National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction (2022)

It’s a meditation on marriage, literature, and the strange interplay between daily life and art.","During the endless days of the pandemic, a woman spends her time sorting fact from fiction in the life and work of Herman Melville. As she delves into Melville's impulsive purchase of a Massachusetts farmhouse, his fevered revision of Moby-Dick there, his intense friendship with neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne, and his troubled marriage to Elizabeth Shaw, she becomes increasingly obsessed by what his devotion to his art reveals about cost, worth, and debt.

Her preoccupation deepens and expands, extending outward to an orbiting cast of Melvillean questers and fanatics, as well as to biographers and writers—among them Elizabeth Hardwick and Robert Lowell—whose lives resonate with Melville's.

Now in his sixties, settled into the comfortable rhythms of retirement and an amicable divorce, he's built a quiet life far removed from the intensity of his youth. But when he receives a mysterious legacy, Tony is forced to confront memories he'd buried and friendships he'd rather forget.

As he revisits his school days and first love, Tony discovers that his recollections may not be as reliable as he believed. The return of figures from his past—one tragically from beyond the grave—unravels the careful story he's told himself about who he is and what really happened all those years ago.

With devastating precision, Barnes crafts a psychological puzzle that forces both Tony and readers to question the nature of memory itself. What we remember, what we choose to forget, and how we reconstruct our histories to live with ourselves become the driving forces of this quietly explosive novel that demands to be read in one sitting.","When a mysterious inheritance forces Tony Webster to revisit his past, he discovers his memories aren't as reliable as he thought.

This brilliant graphic memoir explores a woman who was a voracious reader, music lover, and passionate amateur actor—but also someone trapped in an unhappy marriage to a closeted man, whose own artistic dreams simmered beneath the surface.

When Bechdel was seven, her mother stopped touching or kissing her goodnight forever, creating a gulf that would define their relationship. With her signature blend of humor and heartbreak, Bechdel embarks on a quest to understand this distance between them.

Her search weaves through fascinating territory: the work of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, an illuminating Dr. Seuss illustration, and Bechdel's own adult relationships. This richly layered investigation ultimately leads back to her mother and toward a fragile, real-time truce that will resonate with anyone who has navigated the complex terrain of loving a gifted but distant parent.",Bechdel follows up her masterpiece Fun Home with an equally stunning exploration of her relationship with her artistically gifted but emotionally distant mother. Perfect for readers who loved Crying in H Mart's family complexity.,"Alison Bechdel's cult following for her comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For expanded wildly with her family memoirs, including the New York Times bestselling Fun Home, adapted into a Tony Award–winning musical, and Are You My Mother?

Now, a second thrilling tale of filial sleuthery, this time about her mother: voracious reader, music lover, passionate amateur actor. Also a woman, unhappily married to a closeted gay man, whose artistic aspirations simmered under the surface of Bechdel's childhood . . . and who stopped touching or kissing her daughter good night, forever, when she was seven. Poignantly, hilariously, Bechdel embarks on a quest for answers concerning the mother-daughter gulf. It's a richly layered search that leads readers from the fascinating life and work of the iconic twentieth-century psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, to one explosively illuminating Dr. Seuss illustration, to Bechdel’s own (serially monogamous) adult love life. And, finally, back to Mother—to a truce, fragile and real-time, that will move and astonish all adult children of gifted mothers.","Alison Bechdel’s cult following for her early comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For expanded wildly for her family memoirs, the New York Times bestselling and Time magazine #1 Book of the Year graphic memoir Fun Home, adapted into a Tony Award–winning musical, and Are You My Mother?

""...Magnificent... Whatever issues Bechdel has with her mother, one always has the sense that she likes her as much as she loves her. That affection — and the real sense one gets of her mother reading these pages, running her finger over the tenderly drawn panels of their history — gives this book an urgency and an intimacy that Fun Home, in retrospect, lacked... Bechdel's triumph is not just that she's emerged from her tunnel, with weary but clear eyes, but that she's brought her mother with her. Grade: A""—Entertainment Weekly

""...Are You My Mother is as complicated, brainy, inventive and satisfying as the finest prose memoirs...The tragedy and comedy are so entwined, so gloriously balanced, the reader can't help being fascinated. The book delivers lightening bolts of revelation...I haven't encountered a book about being an artist, or about the punishing entanglements of mothers and daughters, as engaging, profound or original as this one in a long time.

Fear of the government, the medical establishment, and what lurks in her child's air, food, mattress, medicine, and vaccines. She discovers you cannot immunize your child—or yourself—from the world.

In this bold investigation, Biss explores the metaphors and myths surrounding immunity and what they mean for both individual and social bodies. As vaccine fears swirl around her, she researches what they mean for her own child, her community, and the world. She weaves conversations with other mothers into meditations on Voltaire's Candide, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, and Susan Sontag's AIDS and Its Metaphors.

On Immunity becomes a moving account of our interconnectedness—how our bodies and fates are inextricably linked, and how the choices we make about health ripple far beyond ourselves.","When motherhood brings vaccine anxiety, Biss dives deep into our cultural fears around immunity and health. Blending personal narrative with literary analysis, she examines why we're so afraid and what our choices mean for everyone.","Eula Biss is the author of four books, including the New York Times bestseller On Immunity: An Inoculation, named one of the 10 Best Books of 2014 by The New York Times Book Review, and Notes from No Man's Land: American Essays, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism.

He would become one of America's most powerful literary voices, his very existence challenging everything slave owners claimed about Black humanity.

Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass transformed his personal story into a weapon against slavery. By the Civil War, he had become the nation's most celebrated orator, traveling widely to bear witness to slavery's brutality. His voice—both written and spoken—made him a fierce critic of America and a radical patriot simultaneously.

After the war, though he sometimes clashed politically with younger African Americans, Douglass never abandoned the Republican party or the fight for Black civil rights. David Blight's biography draws on newly discovered private collections and recently found issues of Douglass's newspapers to reveal intimate details of his two marriages and complex family life. This definitive portrait captures both the public giant and the deeply human man behind one of the nineteenth century's most important American voices.","The definitive biography of Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery to become America's greatest 19th-century orator and a towering abolitionist.

He was fortunate to have been taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on to become one of the major literary figures of his time. His very existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great intelligence he bore witness to the brutality of slavery.

Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke widely, using his own story to condemn slavery. By the Civil War, Douglass had become the most famed and widely travelled orator in the nation. In his unique and eloquent voice, written and spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the United States as well as a radical patriot. After the war he sometimes argued politically with younger African Americans, but he never forsook either the Republican party or the cause of black civil and political rights.

At the center are four transformative relationships: his mentor, Black American painter Beauford Delaney; his lover and muse, Swiss painter Lucien Happersberger; Turkish actor Engin Cezzar; and French artist Yoran Cazac, whose long-overlooked significance as Baldwin's last great love is explored here for the first time.

Boggs shows how Baldwin alchemized the complex forces within these relationships—geographical, cultural, political, artistic, and erotic—into novels, essays, and plays that spoke truth to power and left an indelible impact on the civil rights movement and Black and queer literary history.

—Imani Perry, National Book Award winner for South to America","Drawing on new archival material, original research, and interviews, this spellbinding book is the first major biography of James Baldwin in three decades, revealing how profoundly his personal relationships shaped his life and work.","Baldwin: A Love Story, the first major biography of James Baldwin in three decades, reveals how profoundly the writer’s personal relationships shaped his life and work. Drawing on newly uncovered archival material and original research and interviews, this spellbinding book tells the overlapping stories of Baldwin’s most sustaining intimate and artistic relationships: with his mentor, the Black American painter Beauford Delaney; with his lover and muse, the Swiss painter Lucien Happersberger; and with his collaborators, the famed Turkish actor Engin Cezzar and the iconoclastic French artist Yoran Cazac, whose long-overlooked significance as Baldwin’s last great love is explored in these pages for the first time.

Nicholas Boggs shows how Baldwin drew on all the complex forces within these relationships—geographical, cultural, political, artistic, and erotic—and alchemized them into novels, essays, and plays that speak truth to power and had an indelible impact on the civil rights movement and on Black and queer literary history. Richly immersive, Baldwin: A Love Story follows the writer’s creative journey between Harlem, Paris, Switzerland, the southern United States, Istanbul, Africa, the South of France, and beyond. In so doing, it magnifies our understanding of the public and private lives of one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century, whose contributions only continue to grow in influence.","Nicholas Boggs was an undergraduate when he discovered James Baldwin’s out-of-print children’s book, Little Man, Little Man: A Story of Childhood, in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

His writing has also been anthologized in The Cambridge Companion to James Baldwin, James Baldwin Now, and Speculative Light: The Arts of Beauford Delaney and James Baldwin. He is the recipient of a 2023 Whiting Creative Nonfiction Grant and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Beinecke Library and Gilder Lehrman Center at Yale, the Schomburg Center Scholars-in-Residence Program, and the National Humanities Center, as well as residencies at Yaddo and MacDowell.

In these ten stories set across contemporary New York City's changing landscapes, characters ranging from children to grandmothers to ghosts grapple with the responsibility of perceiving and the moral challenge of speaking up.

The structures they build around these ambitions and failures shape not only their own futures but the legacies of their families and city.

—Publishers Weekly","An exhilarating novel about one American family, the dark moment that shatters their suburban paradise, and the wild legacy of trauma and inheritance, from the New York Times bestselling author of Fleishman Is in Trouble","“Were we gangsters? No. But did we know how to start a fire?”

In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He is returned to his wife and kids less than a week later, only slightly the worse, and the family moves on with their lives, resuming their prized places in the saga of the American dream, comforted in the realization that though their money may have been what endangered them, it is also what assured them their safety.

But now, nearly forty years later, it’s clear that perhaps nobody ever got over anything, after all. Carl has spent the ensuing years secretly seeking closure to the matter of his kidnapping, while his wife, Ruth, has spent her potential protecting her husband’s emotional health. Their three grown children aren’t doing much better: Nathan’s chronic fear won’t allow him to advance at his law firm; Beamer, a Hollywood screenwriter, will consume anything—substance, foodstuff, women—in order to numb his own perpetual terror; and Jenny has spent her life so bent on proving that she’s not a product of her family’s pathology that she has come to define it. As they hover at the delicate precipice of a different kind of survival, they learn that the family fortune has dwindled to just about nothing, and they must face desperate questions about how much their wealth has played a part in both their lives’ successes and failures.

Long Island Compromise spans the entirety of one family’s history, winding through decades and generations, all the way to the outrageous present, and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the future, old wives’ tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom, dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists, beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared experience that unite a family forever.","Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine and the author of two novels: Fleishman Is in Trouble, which she adapted into an Emmy-nominated limited series for FX, and Long Island Compromise.

Broom's mother Ivory Mae bought a shotgun house in the then-promising neighborhood of New Orleans East and built her world inside of it. It was the height of the Space Race and the neighborhood was home to a major NASA plant—the postwar optimism seemed assured. Widowed, Ivory Mae remarried Sarah's father Simon Broom; their combined family would eventually number twelve children. But after Simon died, six months after Sarah's birth, the Yellow House would become Ivory Mae's thirteenth and most unruly child.

Broom's ambitious memoir tells a hundred years of her family and their relationship to home in a neglected area of one of America's most mythologized cities. This is the story of a mother's struggle against a house's entropy, and that of a daughter who left home only to reckon with the pull it exerts, even after the Yellow House was wiped off the map after Hurricane Katrina.

The Yellow House expands the map of New Orleans to include the stories of its lesser known natives, demonstrating how enduring drives of clan, pride, and familial love resist erasure. Located in the gap between the ""Big Easy"" of tourist guides and the New Orleans in which Broom was raised, this is a brilliant memoir of place, class, race, and the seeping rot of inequality—a transformative story from an unparalleled new voice of startling clarity and power.","When Hurricane Katrina destroyed her childhood home, Broom began excavating a century of family history rooted in New Orleans East.

With Sleater-Kinney, Brownstein and her bandmates rose to prominence in the burgeoning underground feminist punk-rock movement that defined music and pop culture in the 1990s.

This was when he traded his extraordinary power as Senate Majority Leader for the wretched powerlessness of Vice President in an administration that disdained him. Yet it was also when the presidency he'd always pursued would be thrust upon him in the moment it took an assassin's bullet to reach its mark.

By 1958, Johnson was known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his time, the greatest Senate Leader in history. But the 1960 nomination went to John F. Kennedy. Caro gives us an unparalleled account of the machinations behind both the nomination and Kennedy's decision to offer Johnson the vice presidency, revealing Robert Kennedy's efforts to force Johnson off the ticket. With masterful storytelling, he exposes the savage animosity between Johnson and Kennedy's younger brother, portraying one of America's great political feuds.

For the first time, we see the Kennedy assassination through Johnson's eyes. We watch him inherit a staff loyal to his predecessor, a resistant Congress, and a nation in mourning. Within weeks, grasping the presidency with supreme mastery, he propels essential legislation through Congress and creates the revolutionary War on Poverty.

Most impressively, Caro comes closer than any other historian could to explaining the famously complex LBJ . . .

—Darren Franich, Entertainment Weekly",Book Four of Robert A. Caro’s monumental The Years of Lyndon Johnson displays all the narrative energy and illuminating insight that led the Times of London to acclaim it as “one of the truly great political biographies of the modern age. A masterpiece.”,"The Passage of Power follows Lyndon Johnson through both the most frustrating and the most triumphant periods of his career—1958 to1964. It is a time that would see him trade the extraordinary power he had created for himself as Senate Majority Leader for what became the wretched powerlessness of a Vice President in an administration that disdained and distrusted him. Yet it was, as well, the time in which the presidency, the goal he had always pursued, would be thrust upon him in the moment it took an assassin’s bullet to reach its mark.

By 1958, as Johnson began to maneuver for the presidency, he was known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his time, the greatest Senate Leader in our history. But the 1960 nomination would go to the young senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Caro gives us an unparalleled account of the machinations behind both the nomination and Kennedy’s decision to offer Johnson the vice presidency, revealing the extent of Robert Kennedy’s efforts to force Johnson off the ticket. With the consummate skill of a master storyteller, he exposes the savage animosity between Johnson and Kennedy’s younger brother, portraying one of America’s great political feuds. Yet Robert Kennedy’s overt contempt for Johnson was only part of the burden of humiliation and isolation he bore as Vice President. With a singular understanding of Johnson’s heart and mind, Caro describes what it was like for this mighty politician to find himself altogether powerless in a world in which power is the crucial commodity.

For the first time, in Caro’s breathtakingly vivid narrative, we see the Kennedy assassination through Lyndon Johnson’s eyes. We watch Johnson step into the presidency, inheriting a staff fiercely loyal to his slain predecessor; a Congress determined to retain its power over the executive branch; and a nation in shock and mourning. We see how within weeks—grasping the reins of the presidency with supreme mastery—he propels through Congress essential legislation that at the time of Kennedy’s death seemed hopelessly logjammed and seizes on a dormant Kennedy program to create the revolutionary War on Poverty. Caro makes clear how the political genius with which Johnson had ruled the Senate now enabled him to make the presidency wholly his own. This was without doubt Johnson’s finest hour, before his aspirations and accomplishments were overshadowed and eroded by the trap of Vietnam.

In its exploration of this pivotal period in Johnson’s life—and in the life of the nation—The Passage of Power is not only the story of how he surmounted unprecedented obstacles in order to fulfill the highest purpose of the presidency but is, as well, a revelation of both the pragmatic potential in the presidency and what can be accomplished when the chief executive has the vision and determination to move beyond the pragmatic and initiate programs designed to transform a nation. It is an epic story told with a depth of detail possible only through the peerless research that forms the foundation of Robert Caro’s work, confirming Nicholas von Hoffman’s verdict that “Caro has changed the art of political biography.”","For his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson, Robert A. Caro has twice won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography, has three times won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Best Nonfiction Book of the Year and for Best Biography of the Year, and has also won virtually every other major literary honor, including the National Book Award, the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Francis Parkman Prize, awarded by the Society of American Historians to the book that best “exemplifies the union of the historian and the artist.” In 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama.

—Lily Meyer, The Atlantic","The Booker Prize–winning author of The Luminaries brings us Birnam Wood, a gripping thriller of high drama and kaleidoscopic insight into what drives us to survive.","Birnam Wood is on the move . . .

A landslide has closed the Korowai Pass on New Zealand’s South Island, cutting oﬀ the town of Thorndike and leaving a sizable farm abandoned. The disaster presents an opportunity for Birnam Wood, an undeclared, unregulated, sometimes-criminal, sometimes-philanthropic guerrilla gardening collective that plants crops wherever no one will notice. For years, the group has struggled to break even. To occupy the farm at Thorndike would mean a shot at solvency at last.

But the enigmatic American billionaire Robert Lemoine also has an interest in the place: he has snatched it up to build his end-times bunker, or so he tells Birnam’s founder, Mira, when he catches her on the property. He’s intrigued by Mira, and by Birnam Wood; although they’re poles apart politically, it seems Lemoine and the group might have enemies in common. But can Birnam trust him? And, as their ideals and ideologies are tested, can they trust one another?

A gripping psychological thriller from the Booker Prize–winning author of The Luminaries, Eleanor Catton’s Birnam Wood is Shakespearean in its drama, Austenian in its wit, and, like both inﬂuences, fascinated by what makes us who we are. A brilliantly constructed study of intentions, actions, and consequences, it is a mesmerizing, unﬂinching consideration of the human impulse to ensure our own survival.","Eleanor Catton is the author of the international bestseller The Luminaries, winner of the Man Booker Prize and a Governor General’s Literary Award. Her debut novel, The Rehearsal, won the Betty Trask Award, was short-listed for the Guardian First Book Award and the Dylan Thomas Prize, and was long-listed for the Orange Prize. She is also the screenwriter of Emma, a 2020 feature ?lm adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel.

The School for Good Mothers is a chilling, dystopian exploration of motherhood, surveillance, and obedience.","Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn't have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents' sacrifices, can't persuade her husband to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress, and finds perfection only with her cherubic daughter, Harriet. Until Frida has a very bad day.

The state has its eye on mothers like Frida—the ones who check their phones while their children get injured on playgrounds, who let their children walk home alone. Because of one moment of poor judgment, government officials will now determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother's devotion.

Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that a bad mother can be redeemed. That she can learn to be good.

Using dark wit to explore the pains and joys of motherhood, Chan has crafted a transgressive novel about the perils of ""perfect"" upper-middle class parenting, the violence enacted upon women by both the state and one another, and the boundless nature of love.","When Frida Liu has one bad parenting moment, the government sends her to a dystopian institution to prove she deserves her daughter.

—Liz Moore, author of The God of the Woods & Long Bright River

""Gutting and terrifying. Vivid and exquisite.

This book is sharp, shocking, anxiety-provoking, superb. It is exactly what you want, and need, to read.""

—Julia Phillips, author of Disappearing Earth

""Jessamine Chan captures, in heartbreaking tones, the exacting price women pay in a patriarchal society that despises them, that reduces their worth to their viability for procreation and capacity for mothering. The School for Good Mothers is not so much a warning for some possible dystopian nightmare as much as it is an alarm announcing that the nightmare is here. The book is, thus, a weeping testimony, a haunting song, and a piercing rebuke of both the misogynist social order and the traps it lays for women, girls, and femmes. Good Mothers deserves an honored place next to the works of Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler.""

The School for Good Mothers is a chilling, dystopian exploration of motherhood, surveillance, and obedience.","Frida Liu is struggling. She doesn’t have a career worthy of her Chinese immigrant parents’ sacrifices. She can’t persuade her husband, Gust, to give up his wellness-obsessed younger mistress. Only with Harriet, their cherubic daughter, does Frida finally attain the perfection expected of her. Harriet may be all she has, but she is just enough.

Until Frida has a very bad day.

The state has its eye on mothers like Frida. The ones who check their phones, letting their children get injured on the playground; who let their children walk home alone. Because of one moment of poor judgement, a host of government officials will now determine if Frida is a candidate for a Big Brother-like institution that measures the success or failure of a mother’s devotion.

Faced with the possibility of losing Harriet, Frida must prove that a bad mother can be redeemed. That she can learn to be good.

An “intense” (Oprah Daily), “captivating” (Today) page-turner that is also a transgressive novel of ideas about the perils of “perfect” upper-middle class parenting; the violence enacted upon women by both the state and, at times, one another; the systems that separate families; and the boundlessness of love, The School for Good Mothers introduces, in Frida, an everywoman for the ages. Using dark wit to explore the pains and joys of the deepest ties that bind us, Chan has written a modern literary classic.","Jessamine Chan’s short stories have appeared in Tin House and Epoch.

He popularized martial arts in the West, bridged Eastern and Western cultures, and was poised to conquer Hollywood when cerebral edema claimed his life at thirty-two. Yet the legend has eclipsed the man.

Forgotten is the baby born in segregated San Francisco who spent his youth in war-torn, fight-crazy Hong Kong. Forgotten is the curious teenager who returned to America, embracing West Coast counterculture while staying rooted in Asian philosophies. Most importantly, forgotten is the man whose very presence broke barriers and helped define what it meant to be Asian in America at the dawn of Asian America.

Water Mirror Echo—a title inspired by Lee's own philosophy of movement and response—is Jeff Chang's powerful reminder of the man behind the myth. Drawing on intimate interviews with Lee's closest friends and family, thousands of newly available personal documents, and dozens of gorgeous family photographs, Chang reveals how Lee's growing fame ushered in something even more enduring: the creation of Asian America itself.","Jeff Chang delivers a stunning cultural biography of Bruce Lee that goes far beyond martial arts legend.

He has been a USA Ford Fellow in Literature and has won the American Book Award and the Asian American Literary Award.

He created a four-episode PBS digital series adaptation of We Gon' Be Alright and has been featured in ESPN's Be Water, PBS's Asian Americans, and CNN's This Is Life.","""Water Mirror Echo is a remarkable story of a man, the traditions and communities that created him, and the new worlds he made possible.

—Hua Hsu, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Stay True: A Memoir

""[A] panoramic biography....

—Hanif Abdurraqib, National Book Award-winning author of There's Always This Year and A Little Devil in America","A cultural biography, both sweeping and intimate, of the legend Bruce Lee, set against the extraordinary, untold story of the rise of Asian America—from the author of the award-winning classic Can’t Stop Won’t Stop and one of the finest culture observers of our era.","More than a half-century after his passing, Bruce Lee is as towering a figure to people around the world as ever. On his path to becoming a global icon, he popularized martial arts in the West, became a bridge to people and cultures from the East, and just as he was set to conquer Hollywood once and for all, he died of cerebral edema at age thirty-two. It’s no wonder that Bruce Lee’s legend has only bloomed in the decades since. Yet, in so many ways, the legend has eclipsed the man.

Forgotten is the stark reality of the baby boy born in segregated San Francisco, who spent his youth in war-ravaged, fight-crazy Hong Kong. Forgotten is the curious teenager who found his way back to America, where he embraced West Coast counterculture and meshed it with the Asian worldviews and philosophies that reared him. Forgotten is the man whose very presence broke barriers and helped shape the idea of what being an Asian in America is, at the very dawn of Asian America.

Water Mirror Echo—a title inspired by Bruce Lee’s own way of moving, being and responding to the world—is a page-turning and powerful reminder. At the helm is Jeff Chang, the award-winning author of Can’t Stop Won’t Stop, whose writing on culture, politics, the arts and music have made him one of the most acclaimed and distinctive voices of our time. In his hands, Bruce Lee’s story brims with authenticity.

Now, based on in-depth interviews with Lee’s closest intimates, thousands of newly available personal documents, and featuring dozens of gorgeous photographs from the family’s archive, Chang achieves the nearly impossible. He reveals the man behind the enduring iconography and stirringly shows Lee’s growing fame ushering in something that’s turned out to be even more enduring: the creation of Asian America.","Jeff Chang’s first book, Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, was named one of the best American nonfiction books of the last quarter century.

Told through four-color cartoons, family photos, documents, and narrative that's equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious, this graphic memoir offers both comfort and comic relief for anyone navigating the life-altering challenge of elderly parents.

For years, Roz relied on denial, avoidance, and distraction when dealing with her mother and father. But when her elderly mother climbed a ladder to retrieve something from the ""crazy closet""—with predictable results—those coping mechanisms could no longer work.

While the specifics are uniquely Chast-ian—an anxious father slipping into dementia who depended heavily on his wife, and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had long overwhelmed Roz—the themes are achingly universal. Adult children suddenly becoming the parent, managing impossible logistics, hiring strangers for intimate care, and navigating the transition from family home to institution.

This amazing portrait captures two lives at their end and an only child doing her best to cope, showcasing the full range of Chast's talent as both cartoonist and storyteller.",New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast's graphic memoir about her parents' final years balances devastating honesty with her trademark humor.

—Kirkus

""Never has the abyss of dread and grief been plumbed to such incandescently hilarious effect. The lines between laughter and hysteria, despair and rage, love and guilt, are quavery indeed, and no one draws them more honestly, more . . . unscrimpingly, than Roz Chast.""

—Alison Bechdel, author of Fun Home","Something completely new from New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast, a graphic memoir that walks the line between poignancy and humor as she tells the personal story of her parents' final years.","In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through four-color cartoons, family photos, and documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents.

When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""--with predictable results--the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed.

While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies--an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades--the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.

This collection serves as Chee's manifesto on the entangling of life, literature, and politics, exploring how lessons learned from a life spent reading and writing fiction have transformed him.

He examines formative experiences from his life and the nation's history: his father's death, the AIDS crisis, 9/11, the jobs that supported his writing—Tarot-reading, bookselling, cater-waiting for William F. Buckley—the writing of his first novel, Edinburgh, and the election of Donald Trump.

—Isaac Fitzgerald, NBC

""If writing, too, is a form of drag for Chee, it is also an act of mystic invocation and transference...Chee leavens his heaviest topics—the decimation of the gay community in the late 1980s and early '90s, the repressed memory of sexual abuse that inspired Edinburgh—with charming episodes like his stint as a waiter at William and Pat Buckley's Park Avenue maisonette, a job that prompted a crisis of conscience given Buckley's infamous proposal to brand AIDS patients on their wrists and buttocks...Even at his most mystical, Chee is generous; these pieces are personal, never pedagogical. They bespeak an unguarded sincerity and curiosity. Chee is refreshingly open about his sometimes liberating, sometimes claustrophobic sense of exceptionality...He reminds us that whomever a writer pictures as his audience, he is also writing into absence, standing in testimony for the sake of the dead. Like most of the essays here, 'After Peter' pulses with urgency, one piece from a life in restless motion. It is not necessary to agree that How to Write an Autobiographical Novel is itself a kind of novel in order to appreciate that Chee has written a moving and personal tribute to impermanence, a wise and transgressive meditation on a life lived both because of and in spite of America, a place where, he writes, you are allowed to speak the truth as long as nothing changes.""

Born in 1835, the man who would become America's first literary celebrity spent his childhood dreaming of piloting steamboats on the Mississippi. When the Civil War interrupted his river career, young Twain headed west to Nevada Territory and took a newspaper job, writing dispatches that caught national attention for their brashness and humor.

Acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow brings his considerable powers to bear on a man who shamelessly sought fame and fortune while crafting his persona with meticulous care. After establishing himself as journalist, satirist, and lecturer, Twain settled in Hartford with his wife and three daughters, where he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He threw himself into American culture and emerged as the nation's most notable political pundit.

Yet his madcap business ventures eventually bankrupted him, forcing the family into nine years of European exile. He endured the deaths of his wife and two daughters, and his final years were marked by heartache, political crusades, and eccentric behavior. Drawing on thousands of letters and unpublished manuscripts, Chernow captures the magnificent and often maddening life of one of America's most original characters.","Ron Chernow delivers a masterful portrait of Samuel Clemens becoming Mark Twain—America's first literary celebrity.

—Booklist","Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow illuminates the full, fascinating, and complex life of the writer long celebrated as the father of American literature, Mark Twain","Before he was Mark Twain, he was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. Born in 1835, the man who would become America’s first, and most influential, literary celebrity spent his childhood dreaming of piloting steamboats on the Mississippi. But when the Civil War interrupted his career on the river, the young Twain went west to the Nevada Territory and accepted a job at a local newspaper, writing dispatches that attracted attention for their brashness and humor. It wasn’t long before the former steamboat pilot from Missouri was recognized across the country for his literary brilliance, writing under a pen name that he would immortalize.

In this richly nuanced portrait of Mark Twain, acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow brings his considerable powers to bear on a man who shamelessly sought fame and fortune, and crafted his persona with meticulous care. After establishing himself as a journalist, satirist, and lecturer, he eventually settled in Hartford with his wife and three daughters, where he went on to write The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He threw himself into the hurly-burly of American culture, and emerged as the nation’s most notable political pundit. At the same time, his madcap business ventures eventually bankrupted him; to economize, Twain and his family spent nine eventful years in exile in Europe. He suffered the death of his wife and two daughters, and the last stage of his life was marked by heartache, political crusades, and eccentric behavior that sometimes obscured darker forces at play.

Drawing on Twain’s bountiful archives, including thousands of letters and hundreds of unpublished manuscripts, Chernow masterfully captures the man whose career reflected the country’s westward expansion, industrialization, and foreign wars, and who was the most important white author of his generation to grapple so fully with the legacy of slavery. Today, more than one hundred years after his death, Twain’s writing continues to be read, debated, and quoted. In this brilliant work of scholarship, a moving tribute to the writer’s talent and humanity, Chernow reveals the magnificent and often maddening life of one of the most original characters in American history.","Ron Chernow is the prizewinning author of seven previous books and the recipient of the 2015 National Humanities Medal. His first book, The House of Morgan, won the National Book Award, Washington: A Life won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography, and Alexander Hamilton—the inspiration for the Broadway musical—won the George Washington Book Prize.

Trust Exercise is a daring, layered novel about power dynamics in art and life.","In 1982, David and Sarah are freshmen at an elite performing arts high school in the South. Within this rarified world of music, movement, and Shakespeare, they thrive alongside ambitious peers, particularly drawn to classes taught by the magnetic Mr. Kingsley. Here, David and Sarah fall into an innocent but powerful first love.

For a while, the outside pressures of family life, economic status, and academic demands don't penetrate their artistic bubble. But when reality crashes in through a sudden spiral of events, everything changes dramatically.

Then the novel takes a stunning turn. In the second part, readers discover that what they understood to be true isn't completely accurate—though it's not entirely false either. The plot accelerates and tightens until a final revelation reshapes everything that came before.

As captivating and tender as it is brilliantly surprising, Trust Exercise sparks conversations about fiction and truth, friendships and loyalties, while offering profound insights into the capacities of adolescents and the complex responsibilities of the adults who shape them.","When first love blooms at an elite 1980s performing arts school, it sets off a decades-spanning exploration of memory, manipulation, and truth.

—Kirkus","In a 1980s performing arts high school, a romance between two students spirals into a decades-long tale of manipulation, memory, and betrayal. Trust Exercise is a daring, layered novel about power dynamics in art and life.","In 1982 in a southern city, David and Sarah, two freshmen at a highly competitive performing arts high school, thrive alongside their school peers in a rarified bubble, ambitiously devoting themselves to their studies—to music, to movement, to Shakespeare and, particularly, to classes taught by the magnetic acting teacher Mr. Kingsley. It is here in these halls that David and Sarah fall innocently and powerfully into first love. And also where, as this class of students rises through the ranks of high school, the outside world of family life and economic status, of academic pressure and the future, does not affect them—until it does—in a sudden spiral of events that brings a startling close to the first part of this novel.

In the book’s second part, the reader immediately and surprisingly learns that what we understood to have happened thus far in the story is not completely true, though it’s not entirely false either. The plot thickens and speeds up and tightens, until, with a stunning coda, the author reveals a final piece of the puzzle that makes this novel shock and resonate long after the final sentence.

As captivating and tender as it is brilliantly surprising, Trust Exercise will not only incite heated conversations about fiction and truth, about friendships and loyalties, but also leave readers with wise impressions about the capacities of adolescents and the powers and responsibilities of adults.","Susan Choi is the author of Trust Exercise, which received the National Book Award for Fiction, as well as the novels The Foreign Student, American Woman, A Person of Interest, and My Education.

—The Washington Post","This dramatic and authoritative chronicle, breathtaking in scope and ambition, offers a fresh look at Europe’s descent into a war that tore the world apart.","On the morning of June 28, 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie Chotek arrived at Sarajevo Railway Station, Europe was at peace. Thirty-seven days later, it was at war. The conflict that resulted would kill over fifteen million people, destroy three empires, and permanently alter world history.

The Sleepwalkers reveals in gripping detail how this crisis unfolded. Drawing on fresh sources, it traces the paths to war in a minute-by-minute, action-packed narrative that cuts between the key decision centers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, London, and Belgrade. Distinguished historian Christopher Clark examines the decades of history that informed the events of 1914 and details the mutual misunderstandings and unintended signals that drove the crisis forward in a few short weeks. How did the Balkans—a peripheral region far from Europe’s centers of power and wealth—come to be the center of a drama of such magnitude? How had European nations organized themselves into opposing alliances, and how did these nations carry out foreign policy from their tangled leadership structures? Clark reveals a Europe racked by chronic problems—a fractured world of instability and militancy that was, fatefully, saddled with a conspicuously ineffectual set of political leaders. These rulers, who prided themselves on their modernity and rationalism, stumbled through crisis after crisis and finally convinced themselves that war was the only answer.

Meticulously researched, masterfully written, and illustrated with dozens of black-and-white photos, The Sleepwalkers is a magisterial account of one of the most compelling dramas of modern times.","Christopher Clark is a professor of modern European history and a fellow of St. Catharine's College at the University of Cambridge, UK.

As she grapples with questions of memory, security, and what it means to hold on without being undone, she transforms personal devastation into something larger: a frank exploration of how we survive the unsurvivable.

Instead, she delivers something more valuable: honest companionship through loss, darkly funny observations about the absurdity of mourning, and profound empathy for anyone navigating an age defined by grief.","After her best friend's suicide and a devastating burglary, Crosley transforms overlapping losses into a witty, heartbreaking meditation on friendship and survival.

What unfolds is a tense psychological drama that examines the collision between his provocative presence and her carefully constructed world.

Cusk masterfully dissects the power dynamics at play—exploring themes of female fate and male privilege while mapping the complex geometries of human relationships. As the visit progresses, both characters are forced to confront fundamental questions about how we live morally when our internal desires clash with external realities.

At its heart, this is a meditation on art's dual nature: its capacity to both illuminate and devastate. Through precise, unflinching prose, Cusk creates a story that affirms the resilience of the human spirit while refusing to look away from our deepest struggles and contradictions.","When a woman invites a famous artist to her remote home, expecting revelation, she gets something far more unsettling.

She guides students through storytelling exercises, dines with visiting writers, swims in the Ionian Sea with her fellow passenger. Everyone she encounters speaks openly about themselves—fantasies, anxieties, theories, regrets, longings. Through these revelations, a portrait of the narrator emerges by contrast: a woman learning to face profound loss.

Outline examines what's hardest to articulate. It captures the rhythms of conversation, investigates why people tell stories, and questions whether they can ever do so honestly.

Rachel Cusk's Outline is a novel in ten conversations. Spare and stark, it follows a novelist teaching a course in creative writing during one oppressively hot summer in Athens.

It brilliantly captures conversations, investigates people's motivations for storytelling, and questions their ability to ever do so honestly or unselfishly.

—Publishers Weekly","The inaugural novel in the Well-Read Black Girl Books series, The Catch is a darkly whimsical tale of women daring to live and create with impunity.","Twin sisters Clara and Dempsey have always struggled to relate, their familial bond severed after their mother vanished into the Thames. As infants they were adopted into different families, Clara sent to live with a successful, upper-class couple, and Dempsey with a sullen, unaffectionate city councilor.

The catch: this version of Serene, aged not a day, has enjoyed a childless life—the very life, it seems, she might have had if the girls had never been born.

As with most things, Clara and Dempsey cannot see eye to eye on the confounding appearance of this woman. Clara, a celebrity author with a penchant for excessive drinking and one-night stands, is all too willing to welcome the confident and temperamental Serene into her home. But cloistered Dempsey, who makes a modest living doing menial data entry work from the confines of her apartment, is dubious of the whole situation, believing this all to be the insidious ruse of a con woman. Clashing over this stranger who burrows deeper and deeper into their lives, the sisters hurtle toward an altercation that threatens their very existence, forcing them to finally confront their pasts—together.

In February 2021, Dalton discovers a newborn leveret that had been chased by a dog. Fearing for its life, she brings it home, only to learn how nearly impossible it is to rear a wild hare—most perish in captivity from shock or starvation. Through trial and error, she learns to feed and care for the leveret, intending to return it to the wild.

Instead, it becomes her constant companion, wandering fields and woods at night before returning to her house by day. Though Dalton knows the hare faces threats from foxes, stoats, feral cats, and raptors, she never restricts it to the house. Each departure means she may never see it again, yet she understands that confinement would be its own kind of death.

Shortly after John reaches the island, he falls down a cliff and is found, unconscious and badly injured, by Ivar who takes him home and tends to his wounds. “Clear chronicles the surprising bond that develops between these two men…pack[ing] a great deal of power into a compact tale” (The Wall Street Journal) about connection, home, and hope—in which John begins to learn Ivar’s language, and Ivar sees himself reflected through the eyes of another person for the first time in decades.

Unfolding during the final stages of the infamous Scottish Clearances—a period of the 19th century which saw whole communities of the rural poor driven off the land in a relentless program of forced evictions—this singular novel explores what binds us together in the face of insurmountable difference, the way history shapes our deepest convictions, and how the human spirit can endure despite all odds. Moving and unpredictable, “a love letter to the scorching power of language” (The Guardian), Clear is “a jewel of a novel” (The Washington Post)—a profound and unforgettable read.","Carys Davies is the author of the novels West, shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize and winner of Wales Book of the Year, and The Mission House, The Sunday Times 2020 Novel of the Year. Her short story collection The Redemption of Galen Pike won the Frank O’Connor International Short Story Award and the Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize. She has also received the Royal Society of Literature’s V.S. Pritchett Prize, the Society of Authors’ Olive Cook Award, and a Cullman Fellowship at the New York Public Library. Born in Wales, she lived in New York and Chicago before settling in Edinburgh.

“This intriguing and inventive story escorts the reader to an unexpectedly joyous ending that hints at our contemporary interest in new ideas of what a family might be. The writing style is one of clarity and reserved sensibility punctuated with an end-game needle jab. Not to be missed.”—Annie Proulx, author of Barkskins

“Clear is a compact, taut and brilliant novel with an ingenious premise: one man is sent to evict another from his land, but suddenly requires the second man’s aid. Everything gets more complicated from there. The book is about belonging, a dying language, secrets, and a pistol in a box.

This heart-wrenching narrative revolves around one coyote who falls in love and tries to leave smuggling behind.

She survived. Her parents, husband, and two young sons did not.

In this unflinchingly honest memoir, Deraniyagala chronicles her journey through unimaginable grief. She captures those first horrifying moments of loss and the brutal months that followed, when she fought against a reality too devastating to accept yet impossible to deny.

Slowly, over the years, she begins the delicate work of remembering. Her memories take us through the rich life she's mourning—from her family's London home to her children's births, from meeting her English husband at Cambridge to her childhood in Colombo. Throughout, she navigates the impossible balance between honoring her lost family's memory and finding a way to continue living.

This is a searingly beautiful account of survival, written with remarkable poise and without sentimentality. Deraniyagala shows us how memory can be both unbearably painful and essential for healing.","When the 2004 tsunami claimed her entire family, economist Sonali Deraniyagala faced an unthinkable choice: how to keep living.

She has written an engrossing, unsentimental, beautifully poised account: as she struggles through the first months following the tragedy, furiously clenched against a reality that she cannot face and cannot deny; and then, over the ensuing years, as she emerges reluctantly, slowly allowing her memory to take her back through the rich and joyous life she’s mourning, from her family’s home in London, to the birth of her children, to the year she met her English husband at Cambridge, to her childhood in Colombo; all the while learning the difficult balance between the almost unbearable reminders of her loss and the need to keep her family, somehow, still alive within her.","Sonali Deraniyagala teaches in the Department of Economics at SOAS, University of London.

Desmond spent years living in Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods, documenting how families navigate impossible choices between paying rent and buying food, medicine, or heat. He shows how eviction creates a devastating cycle: families forced to move frequently can't build stability, children change schools constantly, and parents lose jobs due to housing disruptions.

In 15th-century Constantinople, orphaned Anna learns to read within the city's formidable walls. In this ancient center of learning, she discovers what might be the last copy of a centuries-old story about Aethon, who longs to become a bird and fly to a utopian paradise.

In present-day Idaho, octogenarian Zeno rehearses children in a play adaptation of Aethon's story, preserved against all odds through the centuries. Hidden among the library shelves is a bomb, planted by troubled teenager Seymour—creating another kind of siege.

In the not-so-distant future, aboard the interstellar ship Argos, Konstance sits alone in a vault, copying Aethon's story onto scraps of sacking, carrying forward the tale her father once told her.

He demonstrates with visceral drama the urgency of the fight for fairness and economic democracy.

This sweeping history illuminates organized labor's vital accomplishments and central role in America's social, political, economic, and cultural evolution.

Washington Black is both a page-turner and a profound meditation on identity.","Eleven-year-old George Washington Black—known as Wash—is a field slave on a Barbados sugar plantation when he's chosen as manservant to his master's eccentric brother, Christopher Wilde. What begins as terror transforms into wonder as Wash discovers Christopher is a naturalist, explorer, inventor, and abolitionist who introduces him to a world of flying machines and scientific marvels.

For the first time, Wash glimpses a life of dignity and meaning beyond his chains. But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash's head, he and Christopher must flee together across the globe. Their shared journey becomes one of separation as Wash searches for his true identity and place in the world.

Washington Black explores what it means to be truly free in a world where humanity must be fought for and won.","When a young slave becomes assistant to an abolitionist scientist, he discovers a world beyond his chains—until danger forces them to flee across continents.

To his surprise, however, the eccentric Christopher Wilde turns out to be a naturalist, explorer, inventor, and abolitionist. Soon Wash is initiated into a world where a flying machine can carry a man across the sky, where even a boy born in chains may embrace a life of dignity and meaning, and where two people, separated by an impossible divide, can begin to see each other as human.
 
But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash’s head, they must abandon everything and flee together. Over the course of their travels, what brings Wash and Christopher together will tear them apart, propelling Wash ever farther across the globe in search of his true self.

―Mark Whitaker, The Washington Post","The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life for our times.","Vividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan Eig’s King: A Life is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.—and the first to include recently declassified FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. King reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American race relations and became our only modern-day founding father.

In this landmark biography, Eig gives us an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, a perplexing husband and father, and a committed radical who led one of history’s greatest movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.","Jonathan Eig is a former senior writer for The Wall Street Journal. He is the New York Times bestselling author of five books, including Ali: A Life, Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig, and Opening Day: The Story of Jackie Robinson's First Season. Ken Burns calls him ""a master storyteller,"" and Eig's books have been listed among the best of the year by The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Sports Illustrated, and Slate. He lives in Chicago with his wife and children.","“Definitive . . . Monumental . . . An extraordinary achievement and an essential life of the iconic warrior for social justice.”―Kirkus

As she chases obsessive love, damage, and transcendence, in Dublin and beyond, her grandfather’s poetry seems to guide her home.

Nell’s mother, Carmel McDaragh, knows the magic of her Daddo’s poetry too well—the kind of magic that makes women in their nighties slip outside for a kiss and then elope, as her mother Terry had done.

Traumatized, Geraldine Coutts refuses to share details of what happened with the police, her husband Bazil (a tribal judge), or their thirteen-year-old son Joe.

Overnight, Joe's world crumbles. His strong mother stays in bed, slipping into depression, while his father struggles with anger and grief, trying to maintain normalcy. Feeling increasingly alone, Joe is thrust into an adult world he's not ready for.

With Joe's help, Bazil searches through legal decisions for clues to the attacker's identity and answers to crucial questions: Was the perpetrator Indian or white? Where exactly was the crime committed—on state or tribal land? Who should lead the investigation?

Frustrated by his father's limitations and hungry for justice, Joe sets out with three friends to find the truth. Their quest begins at the Round House, a sacred Ojibwe worship space, leading to a journey filled with unexpected twists that will transform Joe, his family, and friends forever.

Traumatized, Geraldine Coutts, a tribal enrollment specialist, refuses to share the details of what happened with the police or her husband Bazil, the tribal judge, and their thirteen-year old son Joe.

In one day, Joe’s home life is upended. His strong, steadfast mother stays in bed, slipping deeper into an abyss of depression while his father, struggling with his own anger and grief, tries to maintain a semblance of normality. Feeling increasingly alone, Joe is thrust prematurely into an adult world for which he is ill prepared.

 With Joe’s help, Bazil pores through previous legal decisions searching for clues to the attacker’s identity and motives, as well as answers to perplexing questions: Was the perpetrator Indian or white? Where, exactly, was the crime committed—on state or tribal land? Who should lead the investigation—the tribal police, the state, or federal law enforcement? Frustrated with the seeming banality and limits of his father’s power, becoming increasingly resistant to adult authority, and eager for justice, Joe sets out with his three friends, Cappy, Zack and Angus, to find the truth, a quest that begins at the Round House, a sacred space and place of worship for the Ojibwe. Filled with unexpected twists and surprises both momentous and devastating, it is a journey of discovery that will leave Joe, his family, and his friends irrevocably transformed.

As Madeleine questions why it became trendy to abandon writers like Cheever and Updike in favor of the Marquis de Sade, real life intervenes in the form of two very different guys. Leonard Bankhead—charismatic loner and lost Portland boy—appears in her semiotics seminar, sparking an intense intellectual and erotic relationship.

The characters lead vastly different lives that span generations and social classes. Amma is a newly acclaimed playwright exploring her Black lesbian identity through her work. Her old friend Shirley teaches in London's underfunded schools, growing jaded after decades in education. Carole, one of Shirley's former students, has become a successful investment banker, while her mother Bummi works as a cleaner and worries about her daughter's disconnection from her roots.

Written in an innovative, fast-moving form that borrows techniques from poetry, this polyphonic novel sparkles with wit and emotion.

Girl, Woman, Other is a magnificent portrayal of the intersections of identity and a moving and hopeful story of an interconnected group of Black British women that paints a vivid portrait of the state of contemporary Britain and looks back to the legacy of Britain’s colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean.

The twelve central characters of this multi-voiced novel lead vastly different lives: Amma is a newly acclaimed playwright whose work often explores her Black lesbian identity; her old friend Shirley is a teacher, jaded after decades of work in London’s funding-deprived schools; Carole, one of Shirley’s former students, is a successful investment banker; Carole’s mother Bummi works as a cleaner and worries about her daughter’s lack of rootedness despite her obvious achievements. From a nonbinary social media influencer to a 93-year-old woman living on a farm in Northern England, these unforgettable characters also intersect in shared aspects of their identities, from age to race to sexuality to class.

Sparklingly witty and filled with emotion, centering voices we often see othered, and written in an innovative fast-moving form that borrows technique from poetry, Girl, Woman, Other is a polyphonic and richly textured social novel that shows a side of Britain we rarely see, one that reminds us of all that connects us to our neighbors, even in times when we are encouraged to be split apart.","Bernardine Evaristo is the 2019 winner of the Booker Prize for Girl, Woman, Other, which was a global bestseller and a winner and finalist for many awards including the Women’s Prize for Fiction and the Dublin Literary Award.

One of New Jersey's seemingly quiet seaside towns, Toms River became the unlikely setting for a decades-long drama that culminated in 2001 with one of the largest legal settlements in toxic dumping history. A town that would rather have been known for its Little League World Series champions ended up making history for an entirely different reason: a notorious cluster of childhood cancers scientifically linked to local air and water pollution.

For years, large chemical companies had used Toms River as their private dumping ground, burying tens of thousands of leaky drums in open pits and discharging billions of gallons of acid-laced wastewater into the town's river.

One of New Jersey’s seemingly innumerable quiet seaside towns, Toms River became the unlikely setting for a decades-long drama that culminated in 2001 with one of the largest legal settlements in the annals of toxic dumping. A town that would rather have been known for its Little League World Series champions ended up making history for an entirely different reason: a notorious cluster of childhood cancers scientifically linked to local air and water pollution. For years, large chemical companies had been using Toms River as their private dumping ground, burying tens of thousands of leaky drums in open pits and discharging billions of gallons of acid-laced wastewater into the town’s namesake river.

In an astonishing feat of investigative reporting, prize-winning journalist Dan Fagin recounts the sixty-year saga of rampant pollution and inadequate oversight that made Toms River a cautionary example for fast-growing industrial towns from South Jersey to South China. He tells the stories of the pioneering scientists and physicians who first identified pollutants as a cause of cancer, and brings to life the everyday heroes in Toms River who struggled for justice: a young boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast-growing tumors that had decimated his body from birth; a nurse who fought to bring the alarming incidence of childhood cancers to the attention of authorities who didn’t want to listen; and a mother whose love for her stricken child transformed her into a tenacious advocate for change.

A gripping human drama rooted in a centuries-old scientific quest, Toms River is a tale of dumpers at midnight and deceptions in broad daylight, of corporate avarice and government neglect, and of a few brave individuals who refused to keep silent until the truth was exposed.","Dan Fagin is an associate professor of journalism and the director of the Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting Program at New York University’s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. For fifteen years, he was the environmental writer at Newsday, where he was twice a principal member of reporting teams that were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. His articles on cancer epidemiology were recognized with the Science Journalism Award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Science in Society Award of the National Association of Science Writers.","“It’s high time a book did for epidemiology what Jon Krakauer’s best-selling Into Thin Air did for mountain climbing: transform a long sequence of painfully plodding steps and missteps into a narrative of such irresistible momentum that the reader not only understands what propels enthusiasts forward, but begins to strain forward as well, racing through the pages to get to the heady views at the end. And such is the power of Dan Fagin’s Toms River, surely a new classic of science reporting . . . a sober story of probability and compromise, laid out with the care and precision that characterizes both good science and great journalism.”—The New York Times

“A thrilling journey full of twists and turns, Toms River is essential reading for our times. Dan Fagin handles topics of great complexity with the dexterity of a scholar, the honesty of a journalist, and the dramatic skill of a novelist.”—Siddhartha Mukherjee, M.D., author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Emperor of All Maladies & The Gene

“At once intimate and objective, Toms River is the heartbreaking account of one town’s struggle with a legacy of toxic pollution.

What began as a daughter's grievance against a parent who had abandoned her life became something far more complex when she learned her 76-year-old estranged father, living in Hungary, had undergone sex reassignment surgery.

How was this new parent who claimed to be ""a complete woman now"" connected to the silent, explosive, and ultimately violent father she had known? Faludi chases this mystery through her suburban childhood and her father's many incarnations: American dad, Alpine mountaineer, Amazon adventurer, Jewish fugitive in Holocaust Budapest.

When she travels to Hungary for their reunion, Faludi enters a labyrinth of dark histories and dangerous politics in a country determined to repress its past. Her father's reinvented identity becomes a lens for examining the central question of our time: Is identity something we choose, or something we can never escape?

This extraordinary investigation transcends personal memoir to explore the meaning of identity in families, nations, and ourselves.","When Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Susan Faludi learns her estranged father has undergone gender transition, she embarks on a profound investigation into identity, family, and reinvention. A masterful blend of memoir and detective story that will captivate readers of educated memoirs.","Susan Faludi is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and author of The Terror Dream, Stiffed, and Backlash, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction. A former Wall Street Journal reporter, she has written for The New Yorker, The New York Times, Harper's, and The Baffler.","""In the Darkroom is a compelling, lyrical, and candid exploration of identity, gender, and the intensely complex relationship between a transgendered father and her daughter.

—Publishers Weekly","From the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and bestselling author of Backlash, an astonishing confrontation with the enigma of her father and the larger riddle of identity consuming our age.","“In the summer of 2004 I set out to investigate someone I scarcely knew, my father. The project began with a grievance, the grievance of a daughter whose parent had absconded from her life. I was in pursuit of a scofflaw, an artful dodger who had skipped out on so many things—obligation, affection, culpability, contrition. I was preparing an indictment, amassing discovery for a trial. But somewhere along the line, the prosecutor became a witness.”

So begins Susan Faludi’s extraordinary inquiry into the meaning of identity in the modern world and in her own haunted family saga. When the feminist writer learned that her 76-year-old father—long estranged and living in Hungary—had undergone sex reassignment surgery, that investigation would turn personal and urgent. How was this new parent who claimed to be “a complete woman now” connected to the silent, explosive, and ultimately violent father she had known, the photographer who’d built his career on the alteration of images?

Faludi chases that mystery into the recesses of her suburban childhood and her father’s many previous incarnations: American dad, Alpine mountaineer, swashbuckling adventurer in the Amazon outback, Jewish fugitive in Holocaust Budapest. When the author travels to Hungary to reunite with her father, she drops into a labyrinth of dark histories and dangerous politics in a country hell-bent on repressing its past and constructing a fanciful—and virulent—nationhood. The search for identity that has transfixed our century was proving as treacherous for nations as for individuals.

Faludi’s struggle to come to grips with her father’s reinvented self takes her across borders—historical, political, religious, sexual--to bring her face to face with the question of the age: Is identity something you “choose,” or is it the very thing you can’t escape?","Susan Faludi is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and the author of The Terror Dream, Stiffed, and Backlash, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction.

In this razor-sharp memoir, she chronicles her journey from awkward teenager to comedy powerhouse with the self-deprecating wit that made her famous.

Fey takes readers through her early days as a ""vicious nerd,"" her transformative years in Chicago improv, and her groundbreaking tenure at SNL. She dishes on everything from her halfhearted pursuit of conventional beauty standards to the realities of motherhood (yes, she eats things off the floor). With characteristic honesty, she shares stories about college romance, a nearly disastrous honeymoon, and what it's really like being called ""bossy"" in a male-dominated industry.

For The Good Soldiers, his bestselling account from the front lines of Baghdad, Finkel embedded with the men of the 2-16 Infantry Battalion during the infamous ""surge,"" a grueling fifteen-month tour that changed them all forever. In Finkel's hands, readers can feel what these young men were experiencing, and his harrowing story instantly became a classic in the literature of modern war.

In Thank You for Your Service, Finkel has done something even more extraordinary. Once again, he has embedded with some of the men of the 2-16--but this time he has done it at home, here in the States, after their deployments have ended. He is with them in their most intimate, painful, and hopeful moments as they try to recover, and in doing so, he creates an indelible, essential portrait of what life after war is like--not just for these soldiers, but for their wives, widows, children, and friends, and for the professionals who are truly trying, and to a great degree failing, to undo the damage that has been done.

The story Finkel tells is mesmerizing, impossible to put down. With his unparalleled ability to report a story, he climbs into the hearts and minds of those he writes about.

—Vogue","An era-defining novel about five Black women over the course of their twenty-year friendship, as they move through the dizzying and sometimes precarious period between young adulthood and midlife—in the much-anticipated second book from National Book Award finalist Angela Flournoy.","Desiree, January, Monique, and Nakia are in their early twenties and at the beginning. Of their careers, of marriage, of motherhood, and of big-city lives in New York and Los Angeles. Together, they are finding their way through the wilderness, that period of life when the reality of contemporary adulthood—overwhelming, mysterious, and full of freedom and consequences—swoops in and stays.

Desiree is estranged from her sister Danielle, and the two nurse bitter family wounds in different ways. January’s got a relationship with a “good” man she feels ambivalent about, even after her surprise pregnancy. Monique, a librarian and aspiring blogger, finds unexpected online fame after calling out the university where she works for its plans to whitewash fraught history. And Nakia is trying to get her restaurant off the ground, without relying on the largesse of her upper middle-class family who wonder aloud if she should be doing something better with her life.

As these friends move from the late 2000’s into the late 2020’s, from young adults to grown women, they must figure out what they mean to one another—amid political upheaval, economic and environmental instability, and the increasing volatility of modern American life.

The Wilderness is Angela Flournoy’s masterful and kaleidoscopic follow-up to her critically acclaimed debut The Turner House. A generational talent, she captures with disarming wit and electric language how the most profound connections over a lifetime can lie in the tangled, uncertain thicket of friendship.","Angela Flournoy is the author of The Turner House, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, a finalist for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize, a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, an Indie Next pick, and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.

Class, privilege, power, politics, sex, commerce and the life-or-death dynamics of battle all figure in Billy Lynn’s surreal game day experience.”—The New York Times

Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk is not merely good; it’s Pulitzer Prize-quality good . . . A bracing, fearless and uproarious satire of how contemporary war is waged and sold to the American public.”—San Francisco Chronicle

A genius of literary suspense and psychological horror, Jackson plumbed the cultural anxiety of postwar America more deeply than anyone.

Now, biographer Ruth Franklin reveals the tumultuous life and inner darkness of the author of such classics as The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Placing Jackson within an American Gothic tradition that stretches back to Hawthorne and Poe, Franklin demonstrates how her unique contribution came from her focus on ""domestic horror."" Almost two decades before The Feminine Mystique ignited the women's movement, Jackson's stories were already exploring the exploitation and desperate isolation of women in American society.

The increasingly prescient Jackson emerges as a ferociously talented writer in a time when it was unusual for a woman to have both family and profession. A mother of four and wife of prominent New Yorker critic Stanley Edgar Hyman, she lived a seemingly bucolic life in Vermont. Yet much like her stories, Jackson's creative ascent was haunted by darkness—her marriage became tenuous, anxiety mounted, and she became addicted to amphetamines and tranquilizers.

Based on previously undiscovered correspondence and dozens of new interviews, this becomes the definitive biography of an American literary giant.","Ruth Franklin's masterful biography rescues Shirley Jackson from literary obscurity, revealing the complex woman behind ""The Lottery"" and The Haunting of Hill House. Perfect for fans of literary biographies and anyone who loves psychological horror with serious literary merit.","Ruth Franklin is the author of A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction, a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature, and of Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography.

[Franklin] sees Jackson not as an oddball, one-off writer of horror tales and ghost stories but as someone belonging to the great tradition of Hawthorne, Poe and James, writers preoccupied, as she was, with inner evil in the human soul.""

—Charles McGrath, The New York Times

""Ruth Franklin's sympathetic and masterful biography both uncovers Jackson's secret and haunting life and repositions her as a major artist whose fiction so uncannily channeled women's nightmares and contradictions that it is 'nothing less than the secret history of American women of her era.'""

—Elaine Showalter, The Washington Post

""This meticulous biography tackles the work of Shirley Jackson with the kind of studied seriousness some might give to a male titan of history like Robert Moses. And thank goddess for that, as Ruth Franklin wisely rescues Shirley Jackson from any semblance of obscurity. Despite her well-documented magnetism (and dalliances in the dark arts) Jackson's work was often dismissed as mere genre nonsense or, worse yet, women's fiction and Franklin's sensitive, witty and rigorous work makes an airtight case for just why this isn't right. The ire Jackson's short stories inspired in New Yorker readers is only a hint of the drama and intensity that characterized her short but beguiling life, with Franklin captures with a hefty dose of wit and suspense.

—Lena Dunham","This ""historically engaging and pressingly relevant"" biography establishes Shirley Jackson as a towering figure in American literature and revives the life and work of a neglected master.","Still known to millions primarily as the author of the ""The Lottery,"" Shirley Jackson (1916–1965) has been curiously absent from the mainstream American literary canon. A genius of literary suspense and psychological horror, Jackson plumbed the cultural anxiety of postwar America more deeply than anyone. Now, biographer Ruth Franklin reveals the tumultuous life and inner darkness of the author of such classics as The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle.

Placing Jackson within an American Gothic tradition that stretches back to Hawthorne and Poe, Franklin demonstrates how her unique contribution to this genre came from her focus on ""domestic horror."" Almost two decades before The Feminine Mystique ignited the women’s movement, Jackson’ stories and nonfiction chronicles were already exploring the exploitation and the desperate isolation of women, particularly married women, in American society. Franklin’s portrait of Jackson gives us “a way of reading Jackson and her work that threads her into the weave of the world of words, as a writer and as a woman, rather than excludes her as an anomaly” (Neil Gaiman).

The increasingly prescient Jackson emerges as a ferociously talented, determined, and prodigiously creative writer in a time when it was unusual for a woman to have both a family and a profession. A mother of four and the wife of the prominent New Yorker critic and academic Stanley Edgar Hyman, Jackson lived a seemingly bucolic life in the New England town of North Bennington, Vermont. Yet, much like her stories, which channeled the occult while exploring the claustrophobia of marriage and motherhood, Jackson’s creative ascent was haunted by a darker side. As her career progressed, her marriage became more tenuous, her anxiety mounted, and she became addicted to amphetamines and tranquilizers. In sobering detail, Franklin insightfully examines the effects of Jackson’s California upbringing, in the shadow of a hypercritical mother, on her relationship with her husband, juxtaposing Hyman’s infidelities, domineering behavior, and professional jealousy with his unerring admiration for Jackson’s fiction, which he was convinced was among the most brilliant he had ever encountered.

Based on a wealth of previously undiscovered correspondence and dozens of new interviews, Shirley Jackson—an exploration of astonishing talent shaped by a damaging childhood and turbulent marriage—becomes the definitive biography of a generational avatar and an American literary giant.","Ruth Franklin is the author of A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction, a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature, and of Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography.

He and his girlfriend Rosie Daly had it all planned out—they'd run away to London together, get married, find good jobs, and break free from the poverty and dysfunction of Faithful Place.

But on the night they were supposed to leave, Rosie never showed. Frank assumed she'd dumped him, probably ashamed of his alcoholic father and chaotic family. He left for London alone and never looked back.

Twenty-two years later, Rosie's suitcase turns up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place. Suddenly Frank—now a detective—finds himself pulled back into the dark web of relationships he'd spent decades avoiding.

The cops want him off the case, worried his family loyalty makes him unreliable. His old neighborhood wants him gone because they've never trusted police. But Frank is determined to discover what really happened to Rosie Daly, no matter what it costs him—or anyone else who gets in his way.","When Detective Frank Mackey's teenage girlfriend's suitcase surfaces after twenty-two years, he's forced back to the Dublin neighborhood he fled.

—Salon","Detective Frank Mackey returns to his Dublin childhood neighborhood when a long-buried suitcase reveals secrets from his past. A murder mystery entwined with family drama, Faithful Place is both suspenseful and emotionally gripping.","Back in 1985, Frank Mackey was nineteen, growing up poor in Dublin's inner city, and living crammed into a small flat with his family on Faithful Place. But he had his sights set on a lot more. He and Rosie Daly were all ready to run away to London together, get married, get good jobs, break away from factory work and poverty and their old lives.

But on the winter night when they were supposed to leave, Rosie didn't show. Frank took it for granted that she'd dumped him-probably because of his alcoholic father, nutcase mother, and generally dysfunctional family. He never went home again.

Neither did Rosie. Everyone thought she had gone to England on her own and was over there living a shiny new life. Then, twenty-two years later, Rosie's suitcase shows up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place, and Frank is going home whether he likes it or not.

Getting sucked in is a lot easier than getting out again. Frank finds himself straight back in the dark tangle of relationships he left behind. The cops working the case want him out of the way, in case loyalty to his family and community makes him a liability. Faithful Place wants him out because he's a detective now, and the Place has never liked cops. Frank just wants to find out what happened to Rosie Daly-and he's willing to do whatever it takes, to himself or anyone else, to get the job done.","Tana French is the New York Times–bestselling author of nine previous books, including In the Woods, The Searcher, and The Hunter.

Edgar Hoover, tracing his decades of power at the FBI and his impact on American politics and civil liberties.","We remember J. Edgar Hoover as a bulldog—squat frame, bulging eyes, fearsome jowls—but in 1924, when he became FBI director, he was the trim, dazzling wunderkind of the administrative state, buzzing with energy and reform ideas. He transformed a scandal-riddled law-enforcement backwater into a modern machine.

Hoover believed in federal power to do great things for the nation, but also believed certain people—many of them communists or racial minorities—didn't deserve inclusion in the American project. He rose to power and stayed there for decades, using state tools to create a personal fiefdom unrivaled in U.S. history.

Beverly Gage's monumental work explores Hoover's full life, from his 1895 birth to a modest Washington civil-service family through his 1972 death. Her nuanced portrait shows how he was more than a one-dimensional tyrant—he was confidant, counselor, and adversary to eight presidents. He embodied conservative values from anticommunism to white supremacy, garnering millions of admirers who wanted him in office and supported his actions.

G-Man places Hoover back at the center of American political history, using his story to explain the evolution of governance, policing, race, ideology, and federal power throughout the 20th century.","This definitive biography reveals how J.

—The New York Times",A major new biography of J Edgar Hoover that draws from never-before-seen sources to create a groundbreaking portrait of a colossus who dominated half a century of American history and planted the seeds for much of today's conservative political landscape.,"We remember him as a bulldog--squat frame, bulging wide-set eyes, fearsome jowls--but in 1924, when he became director of the FBI, he had been the trim, dazzling wunderkind of the administrative state, buzzing with energy and big ideas for reform. He transformed a failing law-enforcement backwater, riddled with scandal, into a modern machine. He believed in the power of the federal government to do great things for the nation and its citizens. He also believed that certain people--many of them communists or racial minorities or both-- did not deserve to be included in that American project. Hoover rose to power and then stayed there, decade after decade, using the tools of state to create a personal fiefdom unrivaled in U.S. history.  

Beverly Gage’s monumental work  explores the full sweep of Hoover’s life and career, from his birth in 1895 to a modest Washington civil-service family through his death in 1972. In her  nuanced and definitive portrait, Gage shows how Hoover was more than a one-dimensional tyrant and schemer who strong-armed the rest of the country into submission. As FBI director from 1924 through his death in 1972, he was a confidant, counselor, and adversary to eight U.S. presidents, four Republicans and four Democrats.  Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson did the most to empower   him, yet his closest friend among the eight was fellow anticommunist warrior Richard Nixon.  Hoover was not above blackmail and intimidation, but he also embodied conservative values ranging from anticommunism to white supremacy to a crusading and politicized interpretation of Christianity. This garnered him the admiration of millions of Americans. He stayed in office for so long because many people, from the highest reaches of government down to the grassroots, wanted him there and supported what he was doing, thus creating the template that the political right has followed to transform its party.

G-Man places Hoover back where he once stood in American political history--not at the fringes, but at the center--and uses his story to explain the trajectories of governance, policing, race, ideology, political culture, and federal power as they evolved over the course of the 20th century.","Beverly Gage teaches American history at Yale. Her book G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century received the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Biography, the Bancroft Prize in American History, the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Biography.

Fear and suspicion grip the Holy Roman Empire, and in the small town of Leonberg, Katharina Kepler faces accusations of witchcraft.

Katharina is an illiterate widow known for her herbal remedies and her successful children—including her eldest son Johannes, the Imperial Mathematician and renowned author of the laws of planetary motion. Her prominence breeds jealousy, and Katharina's tendency to involve herself in everyone's business hasn't helped her cause. When the deranged Ursula Reinbold accuses Katharina of offering her a bitter, witchy drink that made her ill, Katharina finds herself in serious trouble.

Her scientist son must shift his attention from the music of the spheres to defending his mother against charges that could lead to financial ruin, torture, or execution. Facing these threats, Katharina tells her side of the story to Simon, her reclusive widower neighbor who harbors secrets of his own.

—Ron Charles, The Washington Post","In 17th-century Germany, Katharina Kepler—the mother of famed astronomer Johannes Kepler—is accused of witchcraft. Based on real events, Galchen’s novel is a darkly funny and poignant portrait of superstition, rumor, and resilience.","The story begins in 1618, in the German duchy of Württemberg. Plague is spreading. The Thirty Years' War has begun, and fear and suspicion are in the air throughout the Holy Roman Empire. In the small town of Leonberg, Katharina Kepler is accused of being a witch.

Katharina is an illiterate widow, known by her neighbors for her herbal remedies and the success of her children, including her eldest, Johannes, who is the Imperial Mathematician and renowned author of the laws of planetary motion. It's enough to make anyone jealous, and Katharina has done herself no favors by being out and about and in everyone's business. So when the deranged and insipid Ursula Reinbold (or as Katharina calls her, the Werewolf) accuses Katherina of offering her a bitter, witchy drink that has made her ill, Katharina is in trouble. Her scientist son must turn his attention from the music of the spheres to the job of defending his mother. Facing the threat of financial ruin, torture, and even execution, Katharina tells her side of the story to her friend and next-door neighbor Simon, a reclusive widower imperiled by his own secrets.

Drawing on real historical documents but infused with the intensity of imagination, sly humor, and intellectual fire for which Rivka Galchen is known, Everyone Knows Your Mother Is a Witch will both provoke and entertain. The story of how a community becomes implicated in collective aggression and hysterical fear is a tale for our time. Galchen's bold new novel touchingly illuminates a society and a family undone by superstition, the state, and the mortal convulsions of history.","Rivka Galchen is the recipient of a William Saroyan International Prize for Fiction and a Rona Jaffe Foundation Writers’ Award, among other distinctions.

Instead, it delivered rising anger and domestic chaos that foreshadowed today's polarization and extremism.

In When the Clock Broke, acclaimed political writer John Ganz chronicles America's late-century unraveling. From upheavals in Crown Heights and Los Angeles to the rise of David Duke and heartland survivalists, from Rush Limbaugh's broadcasts to bitter disputes between neoconservatives and the ""paleo-con"" right, Ganz immerses us in a time when what Philip Roth called the ""indigenous American berserk"" took wild new forms.

The 1992 campaign saw Pat Buchanan's and Ross Perot's populist insurgencies upend the political establishment while Americans grappled with recession, racial anxiety, Asia's rising power, and the collapse of Cold War norms. Conspiracy theories flourished as intellectuals scrambled to understand the ""Middle American Radicals"" whose alienation fueled new movements.

Ranging from upheavals in Crown Heights and Los Angeles to the advent of David Duke and the heartland survivalists, the broadcasts of Rush Limbaugh, and the bitter disputes between neoconservatives and the “paleo-con” right, Ganz immerses us in a time when what Philip Roth called the “indigenous American berserk” took new and ever-wilder forms. In the 1992 campaign, Pat Buchanan's and Ross Perot’s insurgent populist bids upended the political establishment, all while Americans struggled through recession, alarm about racial and social change, the specter of a new power in Asia, and the end of Cold War–era political norms.

The junta launches the National Reorganization Process—a bland name masking their ruthless campaign to crush the political left and instill ""Western, Christian"" values. Their reign lasts until 1983, decimating an entire generation.

One of the military's most diabolical acts is kidnapping hundreds of pregnant women. After giving birth in captivity, the mothers are ""disappeared"" and their babies secretly given to other families—many headed by police or military officers. For the mothers of these vanished women, the grief is twofold: losing their daughters and the theft of their grandchildren.

A group of fierce grandmothers forms the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, dedicated to finding the stolen infants and seeking justice. At a time when speaking out could mean death, they confront military officers, launch protests to reach international diplomats, and become detectives—adopting disguises and working with a renowned American scientist to pioneer groundbreaking genetic tests.

But skyrocketing rents, stagnant wages, and weak tenant protections have created a devastating reality: full-time workers who can't afford housing, especially in booming cities where rapid growth fuels displacement.

In a country where hard work and determination are supposed to lead to success, there is something scandalous about this phrase. But skyrocketing rents, low wages, and a lack of tenant rights have produced a startling phenomenon: People with full-time jobs cannot keep a roof over their head, especially in America’s booming cities, where rapid growth is leading to catastrophic displacement. These families are being forced into homelessness not by a failing economy but a thriving one.

In this gripping and deeply reported book, Brian Goldstone plunges readers into the lives of five Atlanta families struggling to remain housed in a gentrifying, increasingly unequal city. Maurice and Natalia make a fresh start in the country’s “Black Mecca” after being priced out of DC. Kara dreams of starting her own cleaning business while mopping floors at a public hospital. Britt scores a coveted housing voucher. Michelle is in school to become a social worker. Celeste toils at her warehouse job while undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer. Each of them aspires to provide a decent life for their children—and each of them, one by one, joins the ranks of the nation’s working homeless.

Through intimate, novelistic portraits, Goldstone reveals the human cost of this crisis, following parents and their kids as they go to sleep in cars, or in squalid extended-stay hotel rooms, and head out to their jobs and schools the next morning. These are the nation’s hidden homeless—omitted from official statistics, and proof that overflowing shelters and street encampments are only the most visible manifestation of a far more pervasive problem.

By turns heartbreaking and urgent, There Is No Place for Us illuminates the true magnitude, causes, and consequences of the new American homelessness—and shows that it won’t be solved until housing is treated as a fundamental human right.","Brian Goldstone is a journalist whose longform reporting and essays have appeared in The New York Times, Harper’s Magazine, The New Republic, The California Sunday Magazine, and Jacobin, among other publications. He has a PhD in anthropology from Duke University and was a Mellon Research Fellow at Columbia University. In 2021, he was a National Fellow at New America. He lives in Atlanta with his family.","“Deeply reported and written with an empathy that brims from every page . . . [Goldstone] has pulled off a rare and stunning narrative feat.”—Jonathan Blitzer, author of Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here

“A crucial, masterful book that will change the national conversation about homelessness.”—Rachel Aviv, author of Strangers to Ourselves

Anita de Monte, a rising star in the art world, is found dead in New York City. Her tragic death is the talk of the town—until it isn't. By 1998, Anita's name has been all but forgotten.

Enter Raquel, a third-year art history student preparing her final thesis. On College Hill, surrounded by privileged students whose futures are already paved, Raquel feels like an outsider. Students of color like her are the minority, and the pressure to work twice as hard for the same opportunities is no secret.

When Raquel becomes romantically involved with a well-connected older art student, she finds herself unexpectedly rising up the social ranks. As she attempts to straddle both worlds, she stumbles upon Anita's story, raising unsettling questions about the dynamics of her own relationship—which eerily mirrors that of the forgotten artist.

Moving between past and present through both women's perspectives, this is a propulsive, witty examination of power, love, and art that dares to ask: who gets to be remembered, and who is left behind in the rarefied world of the elite?","Two women, decades apart, navigate love and ambition in the elite art world.

Once a beloved father, husband, and celebrated caregiver, Cullen spent sixteen years working across nine hospitals, repeatedly shielded by a medical system more concerned with protecting its reputation than its patients.

Drawing on hundreds of pages of police records, wiretaps, videotapes, and exclusive jailhouse interviews with Cullen himself, Charles Graeber exposes the chilling secrets behind these crimes. But this isn't just the story of a killer—it's also about the detectives and colleagues who risked everything to stop him, especially Amy, a fellow nurse torn between loyalty to her friend and the lives hanging in the balance.

—Publishers Weekly","The chilling true story of Charlie Cullen, a nurse who became one of America’s most prolific serial killers, and the pursuit to bring him to justice.","The Good Nurse by Charles Graeber is the riveting true story of Charlie Cullen, a registered nurse implicated in the deaths of as many as 400 patients, making him perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history. Once a beloved father, husband, and celebrated caregiver, Cullen spent sixteen years working across nine hospitals, repeatedly shielded by a medical system more concerned with its reputation than with protecting patients. Drawing on hundreds of pages of police records, wiretaps, videotapes, and exclusive jailhouse interviews with Cullen himself, Graeber exposes the chilling secrets behind his crimes while also telling the story of the detectives and colleagues who risked everything to stop him—especially Amy, a fellow nurse torn between loyalty to her friend and the lives in his hands. At once a terrifying portrait of madness and a searing indictment of America’s for-profit healthcare system, The Good Nurse is also an inspiring account of the quiet heroes who chose courage over silence.","Charles Graeber has been honored with an Overseas Press Club award for Outstanding International Journalism, an Edgar nomination, and a citation of merit by the British Medical Association. He has contributed to publications including The New Yorker, New York Magazine, GQ, Bloomberg Businessweek, Vogue, The Cambodia Daily, The Phnom Penh Post, The Budapest Sun, The Nantucket Beacon, MIT Technology Review and The New York Times, and been anthologized in The Best American Crime Writing, The Best American Science Writing, The Best American Business Writing, The Best of 10 Years of National Geographic Adventure, The Best of 20 years of Wired and other collections.

Pulling an ancient manuscript from a dusty library shelf, he recognized its explosive potential and ordered it copied immediately.

That book was the last surviving copy of Lucretius's On the Nature of Things—a stunning Roman philosophical epic filled with the most dangerous ideas of its time. It argued that the universe operated without gods, that religious fear damaged human life, and that all matter consisted of tiny particles in constant motion, colliding and changing direction in an eternal dance.

Stephen Greenblatt, one of our most celebrated scholars, traces how this single rediscovered text ignited the Renaissance and shaped our modern world. The poem's revolutionary ideas inspired Botticelli's art and Bruno's philosophy, influenced the thinking of Galileo and Darwin, Freud and Einstein, and left their mark on writers from Montaigne to Shakespeare to Thomas Jefferson. This is both masterful history and thrilling detective story—showing how one manuscript, rescued from a millennium of neglect, made possible the world as we know it.","When a medieval book hunter discovered the last copy of an ancient Roman poem, he unknowingly sparked the Renaissance.

—Emma Donoghue, author of Room","Cast out from court, a young Marie de France becomes abbess of a struggling 12th-century abbey and transforms it into a thriving feminist stronghold. A visionary historical novel of power, mysticism, and women remaking the world.","Cast out of the royal court by Eleanor of Aquitaine, deemed too coarse and rough-hewn for marriage or courtly life, seventeen-year-old Marie de France is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey, its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease.

At first taken aback by the severity of her new life, Marie finds focus and love in collective life with her singular and mercurial sisters. In this crucible, Marie steadily supplants her desire for family, for her homeland, for the passions of her youth with something new to her: devotion to her sisters, and a conviction in her own divine visions. Marie, born the last in a long line of women warriors and crusaders, is determined to chart a bold new course for the women she now leads and protects. But in a world that is shifting and corroding in frightening ways, one that can never reconcile itself with her existence, will the sheer force of Marie’s vision be bulwark enough?

Equally alive to the sacred and the profane, Matrix gathers currents of violence, sensuality, and religious ecstasy in a mesmerizing portrait of consuming passion, aberrant faith, and a woman that history moves both through and around. Lauren Groff’s new novel, her first since Fates and Furies, is a defiant and timely exploration of the raw power of female creativity in a corrupted world.","Lauren Groff is a three-time National Book Award finalist and The New York Times–bestselling author of the novels The Monsters of Templeton, Arcadia, Fates and Furies, Matrix, and The Vaster Wilds, and the celebrated short story collections Delicate Edible Birds and Florida. She has won The Story Prize, the ABA Indies’ Choice Award, France’s Grand Prix de l’Héroïne, and the Joyce Carol Oates Prize, and has been a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

While Arcadia rises and falls around him, Bit must grapple with fundamental questions: How can he honor his love for the peaceful agrarian life while becoming his own man? How will he navigate the world outside Arcadia's protective boundaries?

—Entertainment Weekly","A brilliant follow-up to Groff's bestselling first novel, The Monsters of Templeton, Arcadia is the romantic, lush, haunting story of a great American dream-of a back-to-nature commune that succeeds for a time beyond anyone's expectations and about the lasting impact of the Arcadian experience on a gifted young man born into the idealistic community.","In the fields of western New York State in the 1970s, a few dozen idealists set out to live off the land, founding what would become a commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion called Arcadia House.

Arcadia's inhabitants include Handy, a musician and the group's charismatic leader; Astrid, a midwife; Abe, a master carpenter; Hannah, a baker and historian; and Abe and Hannah's only child, the book's protagonist, Bit, who is born soon after the commune is created.

King Arthur has fallen at the Battle of Camlann, and only a handful of knights remain.

The survivors aren't the legendary heroes like Lancelot or Gawain. They're the Round Table's misfits: Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight; Sir Dagonet, Arthur's fool who was knighted as a joke; and Nimue, Merlin's former apprentice who turned against her master and buried him under a hill.

Now this unlikely fellowship must rebuild Camelot in a world thrown off balance. As God abandons Britain and ancient powers return—led by the vengeful Morgan le Fay—they face an impossible task. They must reclaim Excalibur and restore the broken realm, but first they need to solve the mystery of why their brilliant, lonely king ultimately fell.

But even those inspired by Lorde's teachings on ""the creative power of difference"" may be missing something fundamental about her life and work.

Lorde's understanding of survival wasn't simply about getting through oppression or being resilient in the face of cancer. It was about the total stakes of what it means to be in relationship with a planet in transformation. The focus on Lorde's quotable essays, to the neglect of her complex poems, has led us to ignore her deep engagement with the natural world—the planetary dynamics of geology, meteorology, and biology. For her, ecological images weren't simply metaphors but literal guides to how to be of earth on earth, and how to survive with the ethics that a Black feminist lesbian warrior poetics demands.

In Survival Is a Promise, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, the first researcher to explore the full depths of Lorde's manuscript archives, illuminates the eternal life of Lorde. Her life and work become more than a sound bite—they become a cosmic force, teaching us the grand contingency of life together on earth.","Drawing from Lorde's manuscript archives, this groundbreaking biography reveals how the beloved poet's ecological vision offers radical lessons for survival on a transforming planet. Essential reading for anyone moved by The Prophets or Braiding Sweetgrass.","Alexis Pauline Gumbs is the author of several works of poetry and Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Animals, which won a Whiting Writers' Award in 2022.

—Erika Taylor, NPR","A bold, innovative biography that offers a new understanding of the life, work, and enduring impact of Audre Lorde.","We remember Audre Lorde as an iconic writer, a quotable teacher whose words and face grace T-shirts, nonprofit annual reports, and campus diversity-center walls. But even those who are inspired by Lorde’s teachings on “the creative power of difference” may be missing something fundamental about her life and work, and what they can mean for us today.

Lorde’s understanding of survival was not simply about getting through to the other side of oppression or being resilient in the face of cancer. It was about the total stakes of what it means to be in relationship with a planet in transformation. Possibly the focus on Lorde’s quotable essays, to the neglect of her complex poems, has led us to ignore her deep engagement with the natural world, the planetary dynamics of geology, meteorology, and biology. For her, ecological images are not simply metaphors but rather literal guides to how to be of earth on earth, and how to survive—to live the ethics that a Black feminist lesbian warrior poetics demands.

In Survival Is a Promise, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, the first researcher to explore the full depths of Lorde’s manuscript archives, illuminates the eternal life of Lorde. Her life and work become more than a sound bite; they become a cosmic force, teaching us the grand contingency of life together on earth.","Alexis Pauline Gumbs is the author of several works of poetry and of Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Animals, which won a Whiting Writers' Award in 2022. In 2023, she won a Windham Campbell Prize for her poetry. She lives in Durham, North Carolina.","""Layered and original . . .

The cause? An apparent heart attack.

Bob was a rising star in the competitive, hard-living world of 1970s newspapers—a world of booze-soaked nights that bled into dawn. His sudden death left behind a young widow, two sons, and a fractured family haunted by unanswered questions about that mysterious night.

Thirty-five years later, Michael—now roughly his father's age and a seasoned reporter himself—sets out to uncover the truth. The obituaries said Bob died ""after visiting friends,"" but the details were maddeningly inconsistent. What friends? Where? What really happened?

At the heart of his investigation is Michael's all-too-silent mother, a woman of fierce courage and steely determination not to look back. Working through his father's old newspaper buddies—men bound by an honor code of silence and secrecy—Michael must navigate long-held family myths to reconcile the father he'd imagined with the one he discovers, finding unexpected truths about his mother along the way.","When journalist Michael Hainey's father died mysteriously in 1970s Chicago, his family never spoke of it.

—John Jeremiah Sullivan, author of Pulphead","A decade in the writing, the haunting story of a son’s quest to understand the mystery of his father’s death—a universal memoir about the secrets families keep and the role they play in making us who we are.","Michael Hainey had just turned six when his uncle knocked on his family’s back door one morning with the tragic news: Bob Hainey, Michael’s father, was found alone near his car on Chicago’s North Side, dead, of an apparent heart attack. Thirty-five years old, a young assistant copy desk chief at the Chicago Sun-Times, Bob was a bright and shining star in the competitive, hard-living world of newspapers, one that involved booze-soaked nights that bled into dawn. And then suddenly he was gone, leaving behind a young widow, two sons, a fractured family—and questions surrounding the mysterious nature of his death that would obsess Michael throughout adolescence and long into adulthood. Finally, roughly his father’s age when he died, and a seasoned reporter himself, Michael set out to learn what happened that night. Died “after visiting friends,” the obituaries said. But the details beyond that were inconsistent. What friends? Where? At the heart of his quest is Michael’s all-too-silent, opaque mother, a woman of great courage and tenacity—and a steely determination not to look back. Prodding and cajoling his relatives, and working through a network of his father’s buddies who abide by an honor code of silence and secrecy, Michael sees beyond the long-held myths and ultimately reconciles the father he’d imagined with the one he comes to know—and in the journey discovers new truths about his mother.

—Sports Illustrated","A disastrous error on the field sends five lives into a tailspin in this widely acclaimed tale about love, life, and baseball, praised by the New York Times as ""wonderful...a novel that is every bit as entertaining as it is affecting.""","At Westish College, a small school on the shore of Lake Michigan, baseball star Henry Skrimshander seems destined for big league stardom. But when a routine throw goes disastrously off course, the fates of five people are upended.
 
Henry's fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love. Owen Dunne, Henry's gay roommate and teammate, becomes caught up in a dangerous affair. Mike Schwartz, the Harpooners' team captain and Henry's best friend, realizes he has guided Henry's career at the expense of his own. And Pella Affenlight, Guert's daughter, returns to Westish after escaping an ill-fated marriage, determined to start a new life.

As the season counts down to its climactic final game, these five are forced to confront their deepest hopes, anxieties, and secrets. In the process they forge new bonds, and help one another find their true paths. Written with boundless intelligence and filled with the tenderness of youth, The Art of Fielding is an expansive, warmhearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment -- to oneself and to others.","Chad Harbach grew up in Wisconsin, and graduated from Harvard in 1997.

Through strikingly detailed stories of everyday people—soldiers, sailors and airmen; British housewives and Indian peasants; SS killers and the citizens of Leningrad; Japanese suicide pilots and American carrier crews—Hastings provides an intimate portrait of the world at war. He traces major developments like Hitler's refusal to retreat from the Soviet Union, Stalin's ruthless use of superior numbers to wear down the German army, Churchill's leadership during the dark days of 1940-41, and Roosevelt's steady hand before and after America entered the war.

Hastings also illuminates darker, less explored regions of the conflict, including Finland's fierce resistance against Stalin's invading Red Army and the Bengal famine of 1943-44, when at least one million people died in what became, in Nehru's words, ""the final epitaph of British rule"" in India.

As a young man, his world revolves around challenging the city's pretensions through American music, questionable poetry, and slightly better journalism.

Then comes Chicago: watching helplessly from afar as war erupts in Sarajevo and siege takes hold, with no way home. His parents and sister flee with only the family dog, abandoning everything they'd ever known, while Hemon builds a new life and family in an unfamiliar city.

—Entertainment Weekly","A Montana social worker becomes entangled with a survivalist father and a feral boy living off the grid. Henderson’s rugged debut is visceral, morally knotty, and impossible to shake.","With his clients dispersed in the towns of western Montana, social worker Pete Snow struggles against a lack of professional resources, his crumbling personal life, and a culture that finds solace in the bottom of a bottle and is highly disdainful of government intrusion. After encountering Benjamin Pearl, an undernourished, nearly feral eleven-year-old boy who lives in the backwoods, Pete comes face to face with his own opposite in the boy’s father, Jeremiah: a profoundly disturbed and paranoid survivalist who is itching for a final conflict that will signal the coming End Times.

With courage and caution, Pete slowly earns a measure of trust from the man and boy. But when his estranged thirteen year-old daughter disappears, Pete must face a terrible truth—that someone who cares so deeply for helping others has spectacularly failed his own. When Pearl’s activities spark the full-blown interest of the F.B.I., Pete is thrown into further turmoil as he finds himself at the center of a massive man-hunt, one from which no one will emerge unscathed.

Set against the heartbreaking beauty of Montana’s mountain wilderness, Fourth of July Creek is a timely and unflinching meditation on freedom, community, paranoia, dignity, rugged independence, and the reverberations of brutality and neglect in the lives of the most innocent. Exploring America’s disquieting and violent contradictions, it is a shattering and haunting novel that marks the debut of a major new voice in contemporary American Fiction.

From Key West to Paris, Cuba to Africa, we follow the literary giant as he wrestles with fame's devastating toll while always returning to his sanctuary on the water.

Aboard Pilar, Hemingway found both refuge and ruin. Here he entertained celebrities, fought massive fish, and spent precious time with his children. But the boat also witnessed his marriages crumble, friendships dissolve, and his capacities diminish under the weight of alcoholism and depression.

Drawing on previously unpublished material and interviews with Hemingway's sons, Hendrickson reveals a more complex figure than the familiar caricature. Despite his well-documented flaws, Hemingway showed remarkable generosity to struggling writers and lost souls. Most poignantly, we see his relationship with youngest son Gigi, who lived as a cross-dresser and died alone in a Miami jail—the son who embodied his father's own tortured contradictions.

This bold reconsideration argues that both men were braver than we know, fighting against powerful emotions that threatened to consume them. Published fifty years after Hemingway's death, this stunning portrait forever changes how we understand America's most mythologized writer.","Through Hemingway's beloved fishing boat Pilar, this brilliant biography reveals the writer's final tumultuous decades—showing a more generous, complex man than the familiar caricature.

—Publishers Weekly","From a National Book Critics Circle Award winner, a brilliantly conceived and illuminating reconsideration of a key period in the life of Ernest Hemingway that will forever change the way he is perceived and understood.","Focusing on the years 1934 to 1961-from Hemingway's pinnacle as the reigning monarch of American letters until his suicide-Paul Hendrickson traces the writer's exultations and despair around the one constant in his life during this time: his beloved boat, Pilar.

We follow him from Key West to Paris, to New York, Africa, Cuba, and finally Idaho, as he wrestles with his best angels and worst demons. Whenever he could, he returned to his beloved fishing cruiser, to exult in the sea, to fight the biggest fish he could find, to drink, to entertain celebrities and friends and seduce women, to be with his children. But as he began to succumb to the diseases of fame, we see that Pilar was also where he cursed his critics, saw marriages and friendships dissolve, and tried, in vain, to escape his increasingly diminished capacities.

Generally thought of as a great writer and an unappealing human being, Hemingway emerges here in a far more benevolent light. Drawing on previously unpublished material, including interviews with Hemingway's sons, Hendrickson shows that for all the writer's boorishness, depression, and alcoholism, and despite his choleric anger, he was capable of remarkable generosity-to struggling writers, to lost souls, to the dying son of a friend.

We see most poignantly his relationship with his youngest son, Gigi, a doctor who lived his adult life mostly as a cross-dresser, and died squalidly and alone in a Miami women's jail. He was the son Hemingway forsook the least, yet the one who disappointed him the most, as Gigi acted out for nearly his whole life so many of the tortured, ambiguous tensions his father felt. Hendrickson's bold and beautiful book strikingly makes the case that both men were braver than we know, struggling all their lives against the complicated, powerful emotions swirling around them. As Hendrickson writes, ""Amid so much ruin, still the beauty.""

Hemingway's Boat is both stunningly original and deeply gripping, an invaluable contribution to our understanding of this great American writer, published fifty years after his death.","Paul Hendrickson is a three-time finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and a winner in 2003 for his book Sons of Mississippi.

This gentle boy has little interest in fishing, preferring to spend his days with his neighbor Siok Mei. Everything changes when he discovers an extraordinary gift—the ability to locate bountiful, movable islands that remain invisible to everyone else. Suddenly, he has something valuable to offer his community and a way to impress the spirited girl he's come to love.

As teenagers, Ah Boon and Siok Mei find themselves swept up in history's tragic current. The Japanese army invades, resistance movements rise, grief tears through their world, and their fishing village's very survival hangs in the balance. While their nation hurtles toward rebirth, these two friends must decide who they want to become and what they're willing to sacrifice.

Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of the crew, which included New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.

—The New York Times","A dramatic account of the 1986 Challenger disaster, blending technical detail with human stories of courage, error, and tragedy.","On January 28, 1986, just seventy-three seconds into flight, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven people on board. Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of the crew, which included New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. Like the assassination of JFK, the Challenger disaster is a defining moment in 20th-century history—one that forever changed the way America thought of itself and its optimistic view of the future. Yet the full story of what happened, and why, has never been told.

Based on extensive archival research and metic­ulous, original reporting, Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space follows a handful of central protagonists—including each of the seven members of the doomed crew—through the years leading up to the accident, and offers a detailed account of the tragedy itself and the inves­tigation afterward. It’s a compelling tale of ambition and ingenuity undermined by political cynicism and cost-cutting in the interests of burnishing national prestige; of hubris and heroism; and of an investigation driven by leakers and whistleblowers determined to bring the truth to light. Throughout, there are the ominous warning signs of a tragedy to come, recognized but then ignored, and later hidden from the public.

Higginbotham reveals the history of the shuttle program and the lives of men and women whose stories have been overshadowed by the disaster, as well as the designers, engineers, and test pilots who struggled against the odds to get the first shuttle into space. A masterful blend of riveting human drama and fascinating and absorbing science, Challenger identifies a turning point in history—and brings to life an even more complex and astonishing story than we remember.","Adam Higginbotham has written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Wired, GQ, and Smithsonian. He is the author of Midnight in Chernobyl, which was the winner of the William E. Colby Award and the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction, and Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space. He lives with his family in New York City.","“Stunning . . . Challenger is a remarkable book.

The media paints Faye as a radical hippie with a sordid past, but Samuel remembers an ordinary girl who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? She's facing serious charges and needs his help.

To save her, Samuel embarks on a journey that uncovers long-buried family secrets stretching across generations, all the way back to Norway and the mysterious folklore of the Nix.

The Economist once noted that a short list of the greatest living conversationalists would include Hitchens alongside Sir Patrick Leigh-Fermor and Sir Tom Stoppard—brilliant minds sustained by formidable knowledge, quick wit, and undeniable charm.

This collection invites readers into Hitchens's democratic conversation, where his encyclopedic knowledge unfolds like hearing someone think out loud. He follows logic wherever it leads, unafraid to expose fraud, denounce injustice, or excoriate hypocrisy. His felicity with language—the oxygen in every sentence—has earned him legions of admirers and detractors who read his work with something approaching awe.

Here, Hitchens offers fresh perceptions of figures ranging from Charles Dickens and Karl Marx to George Orwell and Philip Larkin, matched by pungent observations gathered from a lifetime of reporting in Iran, China, and Pakistan. What emerges is an intellectual self-portrait of a writer with exemplary purpose and a profound love affair with the English language—a man anchored in humanity's longing for reason and justice.","Christopher Hitchens at his brilliant best, dissecting everything from literature to politics with razor-sharp wit and fearless intellect.

He is as self-confident on the politics of Lebanon as on the ontology of the Harry Potter books....I still find Hitchens one of the most stimulating thinkers and entertaining we have, even when-perhaps especially when-he provokes.""

—Bill Keller, The New York Times

""One reads him [Hitchens] despite his reputation as someone who wants to drink, argue, and tear the ornaments off the tree, because he is, first and last, a writer, an always exciting, often exacting, furious polemicist. This fact, the most salient thing about him, often gets neglected in the public jousting. Arguably, Hitchens's new collection, forcefully proves this point.

—The Boston Globe","""All first-rate criticism first defines what we are confronting,"" the late, great jazz critic Whitney Balliett once wrote. By that measure, the essays of Christopher Hitchens are in the first tier. For nearly four decades, Hitchens has been telling us, in pitch-perfect prose, what we confront when we grapple with first principles-the principles of reason and tolerance and skepticism that define and inform the foundations of our civilization-principles that, to endure, must be defended anew by every generation.","""A short list of the greatest living conversationalists in English,"" said The Economist, ""would probably have to include Christopher Hitchens, Sir Patrick Leigh-Fermor, and Sir Tom Stoppard. Great brilliance, fantastic powers of recall, and quick wit are clearly valuable in sustaining conversation at these cosmic levels. Charm may be helpful, too."" Hitchens-who staunchly declines all offers of knighthood-hereby invites you to take a seat at a democratic conversation, to be engaged, and to be reasoned with. His knowledge is formidable, an encyclopedic treasure, and yet one has the feeling, reading him, of hearing a person thinking out loud, following the inexorable logic of his thought, wherever it might lead, unafraid to expose fraudulence, denounce injustice, and excoriate hypocrisy. Legions of readers, admirers and detractors alike, have learned to read Hitchens with something approaching awe at his felicity of language, the oxygen in every sentence, the enviable wit and his readiness, even eagerness, to fight a foe or mount the ramparts.

Here, he supplies fresh perceptions of such figures as varied as Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, Rebecca West, George Orwell, J.G. Ballard, and Philip Larkin are matched in brilliance by his pungent discussions and intrepid observations, gathered from a lifetime of traveling and reporting from such destinations as Iran, China, and Pakistan.

Hitchens's directness, elegance, lightly carried erudition, critical and psychological insight, humor, and sympathy-applied as they are here to a dazzling variety of subjects-all set a standard for the essayist that has rarely been matched in our time. What emerges from this indispensable volume is an intellectual self-portrait of a writer with an exemplary steadiness of purpose and a love affair with the delights and seductions of the English language, a man anchored in a profound and humane vision of the human longing for reason and justice.","Christopher Hitchens was a contributing editor to Vanity Fair,Slate, and the Atlantic, and the author of numerous books, including works on Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and George Orwell.

Robert's life was rough from the beginning—growing up on the crime-ridden streets of Newark in the 1980s, with his father in jail and his mother earning less than $15,000 a year.

But Robert was brilliant, and it was supposed to get easier when he was accepted to Yale, where he studied molecular biochemistry and biophysics. It didn't. Robert carried the difficult dual nature of his existence, ""fronting"" at Yale and returning home to Newark.

Through honest portrayals of Robert's relationships—with his struggling mother, incarcerated father, teachers, friends, and fellow drug dealers—this book encompasses America's most enduring conflicts: race, class, drugs, community, imprisonment, education, family, and friendship. It explores the collision between Yale's ivy-covered campus and Newark's streets, and the difficulty of moving between these worlds.

This is a story about poverty, single motherhood, and finding male role models in a community where men are more likely to go to prison than college. Most of all, it's about one singular, brilliant young man whose violent end is heartbreaking and unforgettable.","Robert Peace escaped Newark's streets for Yale, studying molecular biochemistry while navigating two worlds that couldn't be more different. This devastating portrait of brilliance, loyalty, and impossible choices will stay with you long after the final page.","Jeff Hobbs is the New York Times bestselling author of The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award in Biography and Carnegie Medal in nonfiction, and became the 2024 film Rob Peace.

—The Los Angeles Times","A heartfelt, and riveting biography of the short life of a talented young African-American man who escapes the slums of Newark for Yale University only to succumb to the dangers of the streets—and of one’s own nature—when he returns home.","When author Jeff Hobbs arrived at Yale University, he became fast friends with the man who would be his college roommate for four years, Robert Peace. Robert’s life was rough from the beginning in the crime-ridden streets of Newark in the 1980s, with his father in jail and his mother earning less than $15,000 a year. But Robert was a brilliant student, and it was supposed to get easier when he was accepted to Yale, where he studied molecular biochemistry and biophysics. But it didn’t get easier. Robert carried with him the difficult dual nature of his existence, “fronting” in Yale, and at home.

Through an honest rendering of Robert’s relationships—with his struggling mother, with his incarcerated father, with his teachers and friends and fellow drug dealers—The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace encompasses the most enduring conflicts in America: race, class, drugs, community, imprisonment, education, family, friendship, and love. It’s about the collision of two fiercely insular worlds—the ivy-covered campus of Yale University and Newark, New Jersey, and the difficulty of going from one to the other and then back again. It’s about poverty, the challenges of single motherhood, and the struggle to find male role models in a community where a man is more likely to go to prison than to college. It’s about reaching one’s greatest potential and taking responsibility for your family no matter the cost. It’s about trying to live a decent life in America. But most all the story is about the tragic life of one singular brilliant young man. His end, a violent one, is heartbreaking and powerful and unforgettable.","Jeff Hobbs is the New York Times bestselling author of The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace, which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, was a finalist for the Pen/Faulkner Award in Biography, was a finalist for the Carnegie Medal in nonfiction, and was made into the 2024 film Rob Peace.

Maria struggles to care for her husband Ernest as Alzheimer's takes hold. Their daughter Sonja lives in isolation, broken only by episodes of intense romantic obsession.

As the family's annual bonfire approaches—marking both the Cherokee National Holiday and Ray-Ray's death—Maria attempts to bring everyone together once more. But as the date draws near, each family member experiences a strange blurring between the physical and spirit worlds. Maria and Ernest take in a foster child who mysteriously helps clear Ernest's mental fog. Sonja becomes dangerously fixated on a man named Vin, drawn to his connections to tragedy across lifetimes.

—San Francisco Chronicle","Steeped in Cherokee myths and history, a novel about a fractured family reckoning with the tragic death of their son long ago.","In the fifteen years since their teenage son, Ray-Ray, was killed in a police shooting, the Echota family has been suspended in private grief. The mother, Maria, increasingly struggles to manage the onset of Alzheimer’s in her husband, Ernest. Their adult daughter, Sonja, leads a life of solitude, punctuated only by spells of dizzying romantic obsession. And their son, Edgar, fled home long ago, turning to drugs to mute his feelings of alienation.

With the family’s annual bonfire approaching—an occasion marking both the Cherokee National Holiday and Ray-Ray’s death, and a rare moment in which they openly talk about his memory—Maria attempts to call the family together from their physical and emotional distances once more. But as the bonfire draws near, each of them feels a strange blurring of the boundary between normal life and the spirit world. Maria and Ernest take in a foster child who seems to almost miraculously keep Ernest’s mental fog at bay. Sonja becomes dangerously fixated on a man named Vin, despite—or perhaps because of—his ties to tragedy in her lifetime and lifetimes before. And in the wake of a suicide attempt, Edgar finds himself in the mysterious Darkening Land: a place between the living and the dead, where old atrocities echo.

—The Washington Post","Spanning decades and continents, Hosseini’s multivoiced novel traces how a choice made in childhood reverberates through intertwined lives. A compassionate, page-turning epic about family, sacrifice, and the bonds that refuse to break.","From Khaled Hosseini, the #1 New York Times–bestselling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, comes a new novel about love, sacrifice, and the ties that bind families across generations. Moving between Kabul, Paris, San Francisco, and the Greek island of Tinos, Hosseini follows parents and children, brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, exploring how families nurture and wound, betray and honor, and how their choices echo through time. Expansive in scope yet intimate in detail, this powerful story grows richer and more emotionally resonant with every page.","Khaled Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and moved to the United States in 1980. He is the author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers The Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns, and And the Mountains Echoed, as well as illustrated book Sea Prayer. He is A U.S. Goodwill Envoy to the United Nations Refugee Agency, and the founder of The Khaled Hosseini Foundation, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.","“[Hosseini’s] most assured and emotionally gripping story yet . . . Hosseini’s narrative gifts have deepened over the years. . . . [And the Mountains Echoed] grapples with many of the same themes that crisscross his early novels: the relationship between parents and children, and the ways the past can haunt the present. And it shares a similar penchant for mapping terrain midway between the boldly colored world of fable and the more shadowy, shaded world of realism… [W]e finish this novel with an intimate understanding of who his characters are and how they’ve defined themselves over the years through the choices they have made between duty and freedom, familial responsibilities and independence, loyalty to home and exile abroad… a deeply affecting choral work… a testament both to his intimate knowledge of their inner lives, and to his power as an old-fashioned storyteller. ”—Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times

Hsu reflects on music, identity, and grief after the tragic death of his college friend.","Eighteen-year-old Hua Hsu sees everything wrong with Ken—his Dave Matthews obsession, Abercrombie wardrobe, and fraternity life. Ken represents the mainstream conformity that Hua, son of Taiwanese immigrants who makes zines and haunts Bay Area record shops, defines himself against. Ken's Japanese American family has been in the U.S. for generations, yet like Hua, he struggles to find his place in American culture.

Despite first impressions, they become close friends through late-night conversations, cigarettes, long drives along the California coast, and the daily triumphs and failures of college life. Then, senselessly and violently, Ken is killed in a carjacking—less than three years after they first met.

Determined to preserve his memories of one of his closest friends, Hua turned to writing. Stay True is the book he's been crafting ever since—a bracing memoir about growing up, friendship, loss, and moving through the world in search of meaning and belonging.","When Hua Hsu's unlikely college friend Ken is killed in a senseless carjacking, he turns to writing to process grief and preserve memory. A devastating meditation on friendship, identity, and finding your place in America.",Hua Hsu is a staff writer at The New Yorker and professor of Literature at Bard College. He serves on the executive board of the Asian American Writers' Workshop and was formerly a fellow at the New America Foundation and the Dorothy and Lewis B.

In Stay True Hsu makes us see how his and Ken's and their friends' stories are tossed on the sea of history, how identity takes shape from a thousand factors, how personalities flow into one another, how chance and destiny can be hard to tell apart.""

—Lucy Sante, The New York Review of Books

""At once a coming-of-age memoir, a devastating elegy for a departed friend, and a mixtape of all the music and other shards of culture and experience that coalesce into an identity, Stay True is wildly original. Hua Hsu writes with such grace and wry humor about so many things: friendship and loss, being young, the joys of hanging out, the pleasures and comforts of inconsequential passions. A glorious, unforgettable book.""

—Patrick Radden Keefe, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and New York Times bestselling author of Say Nothing and Empire of Pain

""Stay True feels like one of those books that is the sum total of a writer's life in thinking, craft, and curiosity, made felt at last, so that when the sentences come, they come with a deliberate, patient, and precise force. Hsu takes on the central theme of a friend's violent loss and casts from that void a story that, somehow, despite the hurt and confusion, embraces the world around it with a steady and capacious centrifugal force. This is the endeavor of writing at its most open, meticulous, forgiving and tender—which is to say, this is writing at its best.""

—Ocean Vuong, New York Times bestselling author of On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous","A gripping memoir on friendship, grief, the search for self, and the solace that can be found through art, by the New Yorker staff writer Hua Hsu","In the eyes of eighteen-year-old Hua Hsu, the problem with Ken—with his passion for Dave Matthews, Abercrombie & Fitch, and his fraternity—is that he is exactly like everyone else. Ken, whose Japanese American family has been in the United States for generations, is mainstream; for Hua, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, who makes ’zines and haunts Bay Area record shops, Ken represents all that he defines himself in opposition to. The only thing Hua and Ken have in common is that, however they engage with it, American culture doesn’t seem to have a place for either of them.

But despite his first impressions, Hua and Ken become friends, a friendship built on late-night conversations over cigarettes, long drives along the California coast, and the successes and humiliations of everyday college life. And then violently, senselessly, Ken is gone, killed in a carjacking, not even three years after the day they first meet.

Determined to hold on to all that was left of one of his closest friends—his memories—Hua turned to writing. Stay True is the book he’s been working on ever since.

It is told through Jahren’s remarkable stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.

Brutal, funny, and operatic, it’s a modern classic about power, violence, and survival.","On December 3, 1976, seven gunmen stormed Bob Marley's Kingston home with machine guns blazing. The attack came just before Jamaica's general election and two days before Marley's Smile Jamaica Concert—a performance meant to ease political tensions. The singer, his wife, and manager were wounded, but little was officially released about the gunmen's identities or motives.

Marlon James transforms this real event into an explosive literary epic that spans thirty years.

James creates an unforgettable cast of characters whose fates remain intertwined long after that violent December night. Each voice is distinct, raw, and authentic as they navigate a world where political violence, drug trade, and survival intersect. This is storytelling on an ambitious scale—a mesmerizing exploration of how one moment of violence ripples through time, proving that evil casts long shadows and no one truly escapes their fate.","Seven gunmen storm Bob Marley's house in 1976 Kingston, setting off a thirty-year saga of violence and survival.

—The Washington Post","A “thrilling, ambitious . . . intense” (Los Angeles Times) novel that explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in the late 1970s, from the author of Black Leopard, Red Wolf","In A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James combines brilliant storytelling with his unrivaled skills of characterization and meticulous eye for detail to forge an enthralling novel of dazzling ambition and scope.

On December 3, 1976, just before the Jamaican general election and two days before Bob Marley was to play the Smile Jamaica Concert to ease political tensions in Kingston, seven gunmen stormed the singer’s house, machine guns blazing. The attack wounded Marley, his wife, and his manager, and injured several others. Little was officially released about the gunmen, but much has been whispered, gossiped and sung about in the streets of West Kingston. Rumors abound regarding the assassins’ fates, and there are suspicions  that the attack was politically motivated.

A Brief History of Seven Killings delves deep into that dangerous and unstable time in Jamaica’s history and beyond. James deftly chronicles the lives of a host of unforgettable characters – gunmen, drug dealers, one-night stands, CIA agents,  even ghosts – over the course of thirty years as they roam the streets of 1970s Kingston, dominate the crack houses of 1980s New York, and ultimately reemerge into the radically altered Jamaica of the 1990s. Along the way, they learn that evil does indeed cast long shadows, that justice and retribution are inextricably linked, and that no one can truly escape his fate.

It is said that Aesi works so closely with the king that together they are like the eight limbs of one spider. His power is considerable and deadly, requiring both brains and courage to challenge him, which Sogolon does for reasons entirely her own.

Both a brilliant narrative device and a fascinating battle between different versions of empire, Moon Witch, Spider King delves into Sogolon's world as she fights to tell her own story. Part adventure tale, part chronicle of an indomitable woman who bows to no man, it explores the dangerous places where power and personality collide.","Sogolon the Moon Witch gets her revenge story in this epic fantasy sequel.

—The Washington Post","From Marlon James, author of the bestselling National Book Award finalist Black Leopard, Red Wolf, the second book in the Dark Star trilogy.","In Black Leopard, Red Wolf, Sogolon the Moon Witch proved a worthy adversary to Tracker as they clashed across a mythical African landscape in search of a mysterious boy who disappeared.

—Kirkus","In the stunning first novel in Marlon James's Dark Star trilogy, myth, fantasy, and history come together to explore what happens when a mercenary is hired to find a missing child.","Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: ""He has a nose,"" people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.

As Tracker follows the boy's scent--from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers--he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying?

Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written a novel unlike anything that's come before it: a saga of breathtaking adventure that's also an ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf is both surprising and profound as it explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, and our need to understand them both.","Marlon James is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Black Leopard, Red Wolf, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, and A Brief History of Seven Killings, which won the 2015 Man Booker Prize, as well as the novels The Book of Night Women and John Crow’s Devil.

Part absurd entertainment, part tender reinvention of the sexual, romantic, and domestic life of a forty-five-year-old female artist, All Fours transcends expectation while excavating our beliefs about life lived as a woman. Once again, July hijacks the familiar and turns it into something new and thrillingly, profoundly alive.","Miranda July is a writer, filmmaker, and artist. The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and one of TIME magazine’s “100 most influential people of 2025,” she is the New York Times bestselling author of two novels, All Fours and The First Bad Man, and one story collection, No One Belongs Here More Than You. All Fours was named a finalist for the National Book Award, the Women's Prize, and the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction. Her writing has appeared in The Paris Review, Harper’s, and The New Yorker. She lives in Los Angeles.","“All Fours has spurred a whisper network of women fantasizing about desire and freedom...It’s the talk of every group text.""—The New York Times

In an instant, he transformed from doctor treating the dying to patient struggling to live, and the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated.

When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's journey from medical student possessed by questions of what makes life virtuous and meaningful, to Stanford neurosurgeon working in the brain—the most critical place for human identity—to patient and new father confronting his own mortality.

What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future flattens from a ladder toward goals into a perpetual present? What does it mean to nurture new life as another fades away? These are the profound questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this exquisitely observed memoir.

Though Paul died in March 2015 while working on this book, his words endure as both guide and gift. As he wrote: ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality had changed nothing and everything."" This unforgettable reflection on mortality and the doctor-patient relationship comes from a brilliant writer who became both.","When a brilliant neurosurgeon receives a terminal cancer diagnosis at thirty-six, he transforms from doctor to patient overnight. This profound meditation on mortality and meaning will stay with you long after the final page.","Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and writer who graduated from Stanford University with degrees in English literature and human biology. He earned an MPhil in history and philosophy of science from Cambridge and graduated cum laude from Yale School of Medicine, where he was inducted into Alpha Omega Alpha. He completed his neurosurgery residency and neuroscience fellowship at Stanford, receiving the American Academy of Neurological Surgery's highest research award. He died in March 2015, survived by his wife Lucy and daughter Elizabeth Acadia.","""I guarantee that finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option. . . . Part of this book's tremendous impact comes from the obvious fact that its author was such a brilliant polymath. None of it is maudlin. Nothing is exaggerated. As he wrote to a friend: 'It's just tragic enough and just imaginable enough.' And just important enough to be unmissable.""

—Janet Maslin, The New York Times

""Paul Kalanithi's memoir, When Breath Becomes Air, written as he faced a terminal cancer diagnosis, is inherently sad. But it's an emotional investment well worth making: a moving and thoughtful memoir of family, medicine and literature. It is, despite its grim undertone, accidentally inspiring.""

—The Washington Post

""Kalanithi uses the pages in this book to not only tell his story, but also share his ideas on how to approach death with grace and what it means to be fully alive.""

—James Clear, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Atomic Habits","This inspiring, exquisitely observed memoir finds hope and beauty in the face of insurmountable odds as an idealistic young neurosurgeon attempts to answer the question, What makes a life worth living?","At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.

What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.

Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and writer. He grew up in Kingman, Arizona, and graduated from Stanford University with a BA and MA in English literature and a BA in human biology. He earned an MPhil in history and philosophy of science and medicine from the University of Cambridge and graduated cum laude from the Yale School of Medicine, where he was inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha national medical honor society. He returned to Stanford to complete his residency training in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience, during which he received the American Academy of Neurological Surgery’s highest award for research. He died in March 2015.

—Keith Staskiewicz, Entertainment Weekly","Kean spins the history of genetics into witty tales of discovery, genius, and eccentricity, blending science with storytelling flair.","In The Disappearing Spoon, bestselling author Sam Kean unlocked the mysteries of the periodic table. In The Violinist's Thumb, he explores the wonders of the magical building block of life: DNA.

There are genes to explain crazy cat ladies, why other people have no fingerprints, and why some people survive nuclear bombs. Genes illuminate everything from JFK's bronze skin (it wasn't a tan) to Einstein's genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.

Kean's vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species' future.","Sam Kean is the New York Times bestselling author of The Bastard Brigade, Caesar's Last Breath (the Guardian's Science Book of the Year), The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons, The Violinist's Thumb, and The Disappearing Spoon.

Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it.

In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress—with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.

Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by violent guerrilla war, whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell short of a united Ireland, left wondering whether their killings were justified acts of war or simple murders.

From radical terrorists like Dolours Price, planting bombs in London while barely out of her teens, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games of the British Army and Gerry Adams, who negotiated peace while denying his I.R.A. past—Say Nothing conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.","Using one mother's disappearance as its anchor, this masterpiece unravels decades of violence in Northern Ireland.

Their name adorns prestigious institutions like Harvard, the Met, Oxford, and the Louvre. They're one of the world's richest families, but the source of their fortune remained mysteriously vague until a shocking truth emerged: the Sacklers were responsible for creating and marketing the blockbuster painkiller that sparked America's opioid crisis.

Empire of Pain traces three generations of this singular family and their indelible mark on the world. The saga moves from bustling early twentieth-century Brooklyn to seaside Greenwich palaces and Cap d'Antibes, through Washington's corridors of power. It follows their early Valium success to the far more potent OxyContin, marketed through ruthless tactics—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, systematically downplaying addiction risks.

Keefe chronicles multiple investigations into the Sacklers and their company, revealing the scorched-earth legal strategies they've deployed to evade accountability.

Then Joseph Goebbels sees the potential in this European film icon and makes big promises to Pabst's family.

Pabst faces a thinly veiled order from the propaganda minister.

Through it all, he reckons with his own invisibility in a culture where even superheroes have abandoned rural people for cities.

Inspired by Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, Barbara Kingsolver transposes a Victorian epic to the contemporary American South, enlisting Dickens' anger, compassion, and faith in storytelling's transformative power.

And what a story it is: acute, impassioned, heartbreakingly evocative, told by a narrator who's a product of multiple failed systems, yes, but also of a deep rural landscape with its own sustaining traditions.""

Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.

Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens’ anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can’t imagine leaving behind.

","Barbara Kingsolver is the author of ten bestselling works of fiction, including the novels Unsheltered, The Bean Trees, and The Poisonwood Bible, as well as books of poetry, essays, creative nonfiction, and Coyote’s Wild Home, a children’s book co-authored with Lily Kingsolver. She also collaborated with family members on the influential Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life. Kingsolver’s work has been translated into more than thirty languages and has earned a devoted readership at home and abroad. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and has received numerous awards and honors including the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel, Demon Copperhead, the National Humanities Medal, and most recently, the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and its Lifetime Achievement Award. She lives with her husband on a farm in southern Appalachia.","“An Appalachian David Copperfield. . . . Demon Copperhead reimagines Dickens’s story in a modern-day rural America contending with poverty and opioid addiction. . . . Like Dickens, she is unblushingly political and works on a sprawling scale...Episode by episode she persuasively conveys the mind of a teenage boy. . . . It’s hard to think of another living novelist who could take a stab at Dickens and rise above the level of catastrophe.”—The New York Times

“An epic…brimming with vitality and outrage….the rare 560-page book you wish would never end.”—People Magazine

“With its bold reversals of fate and flamboyant cast, this is storytelling on a grand scale. . . . As Demon discovers, owning his story—every part of it—and finding a way to tell it is how he’ll wrest some control over his life. And what a story it is: acute, impassioned, heartbreakingly evocative, told by a narrator who’s a product of multiple failed systems, yes, but also of a deep rural landscape with its own sustaining traditions.”—The Guardian","Winner — Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (2023)

Klay’s debut captures the fractured lives of soldiers navigating violence, alienation, and duty.","In Redeployment, Phil Klay delivers unflinching stories that capture the brutal realities of war and its aftermath. A soldier who shot dogs feeding on human corpses struggles to readjust to suburban life, surrounded by people who have no idea where Fallujah is or that three members of his platoon died there. A Lance Corporal seeks forgiveness for a killing he didn't commit to unburden his best friend. A Mortuary Affairs Marine collects remains of both U.S. and Iraqi soldiers.

A chaplain watches his faith and ability to provide comfort tested by a ferocious Colonel's actions. In the darkly comic ""Money as a Weapons System,"" a young Foreign Service Officer faces the absurd task of teaching Iraqis to play baseball to improve their lives.

These stories reveal the intricate mix of monotony, bureaucracy, brotherhood, and violence that defines a soldier's daily reality, alongside the isolation, guilt, and despair that can follow them home. Written with hard-eyed realism and devastating emotional depth, Redeployment establishes Klay as a powerful new voice in the tradition of great war literature.","Phil Klay's devastating debut captures the brutal realities of Iraq and Afghanistan through the eyes of Marines navigating war and homecoming.

Patients),0,,Hardcover,400,"Kolker tells the remarkable story of a mid-century American family with twelve children, six diagnosed with schizophrenia, blending family saga with medical history.","Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don's Air Force work brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for families like the Galvins—aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony—and they worked hard to play their parts.

But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?

What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of schizophrenia science, from the era of institutionalization and lobotomy to the search for genetic markers, always amid profound disagreements about the illness itself.

With clarity and compassion, bestselling author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.",Six brothers in one family diagnosed with schizophrenia—this devastating true story reveals how the Galvins became crucial to mental health research. Perfect for readers who were moved by The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down.,"Robert Kolker is the New York Times bestselling author of Lost Girls, named one of the New York Times's 100 Notable Books and one of Publishers Weekly's Top Ten Books of 2013.

He's a National Magazine Award finalist and recipient of the 2011 Harry Frank Guggenheim Award for Excellence in Criminal Justice Reporting.","""This broad-ranging, highly readable, and deeply unsettling book tells the story of a family beset with schizophrenia, and in doing so provides meaningful insights into the devastation caused by the disease. It is, equally, a study of the multiple ways in which familial denial can exacerbate the inherent pain of mental illness, and of the courage required both of those who are themselves diagnosed with it and of those who choose to help and support them.""

So what if June edits Athena's novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? The New York Times bestseller list seems to agree with her choices.

But June can't escape Athena's shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring her stolen success crashing down. As she races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she'll go to keep what she thinks she deserves.

—NPR","What’s the harm in a pseudonym? Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel. ","Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars: same year at Yale, same debut year in publishing. But Athena’s a cross-genre literary darling, and June didn’t even get a paperback release. Nobody wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.

So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers to the British and French war efforts during World War I.

So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.

But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.

With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface takes on questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation not only in the publishing industry but the persistent erasure of Asian-American voices and history by Western white society. R. F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","Rebecca F. Kuang is the #1 New York Times and #1 Sunday Times bestselling author of the Poppy War trilogy, Babel: An Arcane History, and Yellowface. Her work has won the Nebula, Locus, Crawford, and British Book Awards. A Marshall Scholar, she has an MPhil in Chinese Studies from Cambridge and an MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies from Oxford. She is now pursuing a PhD in East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale, where she studies diaspora, contemporary Sinophone literature, and Asian American literature.","“This is a great read.

He is the author of Antarctica starts here (2009), a short story collection; After the Light (2016), a series of scientific, philosophical, and historical notes on the void; The Stone of Madness (2021), a diptych on madness, chaos, and modernity; and When We Cease to Understand the World (2021), a book that explores the ecstasy and agony of scientific breakthroughs and has been translated into over thirty languages.","“Labatut’s latest virtuosic effort, at once a historical novel and a philosophical foray, is a thematic sequel, an exploration of what results when we take reason to even further extremes . . . A contemporary writer of thrilling originality . . . The MANIAC is a work of dark, eerie and singular beauty.”—Becca Rothfeld, The Washington Post

“Labatut elegantly captures the sense of geniuses outstripping the typical boundaries of intellectual achievement and paying a price for it . . . Sharply written fiction ably capturing primitive emotions and boundary-breaking research.”—Kirkus

“After the slender yet incendiary When We Cease to Understand the World, Labatut returns with a sensational epic of the Hungarian American physicist and computer scientist John von Neumann . . . Labatut mesmerizes in his accessible depictions of complex scientific material and in his inspired portraits of the innovators. In his previous book, Labatut grappled with the ways in which scientific breakthroughs offered new means of experiencing reality; this one succeeds at showing how acts of genius might break the world forever.

Dazzling in form and scope, it’s a novel about art, myth, and reinvention.","When X—an iconoclastic artist and shape-shifter—falls dead in her office, her widow CM, wild with grief, hurls herself into writing X's biography. Though X was recognized as a crucial creative force of her era, she kept a tight grip on her life story. In CM's quest to unravel it, she opens a Pandora's box of secrets and destruction.

All the while, she immerses herself in the history of the Southern Territory, a fascist theocracy that split from the rest of the country after World War II, as it is finally, in the present day, forced into an uneasy reunification.

A masterfully constructed literary adventure complete with original images assembled by X's widow, Biography of X follows CM as she traces X's peripatetic trajectory over decades, from Europe to the ruins of America's divided territories, and through her collaborations and feuds with everyone from Bowie and Waits to Sontag and Acker. When she finally understands the scope of X's defining artistic project, CM realizes her wife's deceptions were far crueler than she imagined.

Born just fifteen months apart, Subhash and Udayan Mitra are inseparable brothers in their Calcutta neighborhood, often mistaken for one another. But they are opposites with vastly different futures ahead. In the turbulent 1960s, charismatic and impulsive Udayan is drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion to eradicate poverty and inequity. He will risk everything for his beliefs. Subhash, the dutiful son, doesn't share his brother's political passion and leaves home to pursue scientific research in quiet coastal America.

When Subhash learns what happened to his brother in the lowland outside their family home, he returns to India, hoping to heal the wounds Udayan left behind—including those in his brother's wife's heart.

Masterly suspenseful and piercingly intimate, The Lowland is a work of great beauty and complex emotion—an engrossing family saga steeped in history that spans generations and geographies with seamless authenticity.","Two inseparable brothers in 1960s Calcutta choose drastically different paths when political revolution tears their world apart.

Here worlds, new and old, contain terrors.""

—Ann Hulbert

""Lahiri tracks, with patience and tenacity, the emotional and geographical distances that time opens up between people, the things that get lost in those spaces, and the rare and surprising things that endure.

Born just fifteen months apart, Subhash and Udayan Mitra are inseparable brothers, one often mistaken for the other in the Calcutta neighborhood where they grow up. But they are also opposites, with gravely different futures ahead. It is the 1960s, and Udayan—charismatic and impulsive—finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty; he will give everything, risk all, for what he believes. Subhash, the dutiful son, does not share his brother’s political passion; he leaves home to pursue a life of scientific research in a quiet, coastal corner of America.

But when Subhash learns what happened to his brother in the lowland outside their family’s home, he goes back to India, hoping to pick up the pieces of a shattered family, and to heal the wounds Udayan left behind—including those seared in the heart of his brother’s wife.

Transferred to a retention center, Sara joins other dreamers—all women trying to prove their innocence from predicted crimes. Every rule violation extends their stay, and the facility's regulations shift constantly. Months drag by with no release in sight.

Then a new resident arrives, disrupting the center's rigid order and setting Sara on a collision course with the very companies that stripped away her freedom. As she fights back, Sara must navigate a world where even her most private thoughts aren't safe from surveillance.

A French-speaking kid from Canada, Lanois was driven by his innate curiosity and intense love of music to transcend his small-town origins and become one of the world's most prolific and successful record producers, as well as a brilliant musician in his own right.

Lanois takes us through his childhood—from being one of four kids raised by a single mother on a hairdresser's salary—to his discovery by Brian Eno, to his work on albums such as U2's The Joshua Tree, Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind, and Emmylou Harris's Wrecking Ball. Revealing for the first time his unique recording secrets and innovations, Lanois delves into the ongoing evolution of technology, from his earliest sonic experiments with reel-to-reel decks to the birth of the microchip and the arrival of the download era.

Part technological treatise, part philosophical manifesto on the nature of artistic excellence, Soul Mining brings readers viscerally inside the recording studio. Beyond skill, budgets, and ego, Lanois's work shows the value of dedication and soul in his lifelong quest to find the perfect mixture of tradition and innovation.","Behind some of music's greatest albums sits Daniel Lanois, the Canadian producer who shaped sounds for U2, Bob Dylan, and Emmylou Harris. His memoir reveals recording secrets and the soul behind the studio magic.",Daniel Lanois is one of the most respected and sought-after producers in the music industry. He has won eight Grammy Awards and is also well-known for his own music. He is currently in the band Black Dub.,"""This book is bursting with memorable anecdotes about [Lanois's] collaborators, another of the debut author's many gifts to fans of rock and country music.""

—Kevin Canfield, San Francisco Chronicle

""The master musician and producer offers a typically idiosyncratic take on his life and art . . . Readers will savor the unique character of the producer's unconventional technique, which often employs setting up a jerry-rigged studio with vintage gear in an exotic locale. . . Lanois' book bursts with atmosphere and feeling. He is that rare breed, a lyrical technocrat, and he emerges from the work as one of music's most unusual and charismatic figures. There's really nothing like this oft-rapturous work in the canon of musical memoirs.""

And that makes this a real treat for serious music fans.""

—Booklist","Legendary producer Daniel Lanois reflects on his life in music, from working with U2 and Bob Dylan to his own creative journey.","Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, U2, Peter Gabriel, and the Neville Brothers all have something in common: some of their best albums were produced by Daniel Lanois. A French-speaking kid from Canada, Lanois was driven by his innate curiosity and intense love of music to transcend his small-town origins and become one of the world's most prolific and successful record producers, as well as a brilliant musician in his own right.


Lanois takes us through his childhood, from being one of four kids raised by a single mother on a hairdresser's salary, to his discovery by Brian Eno, to his work on albums such as U2's The Joshua Tree, Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind, and Emmylou Harris's Wrecking Ball. Revealing for the first time ever his unique recording secrets and innovations, Lanois delves into the ongoing evolution of technology, discussing his earliest sonic experiments with reel-to-reel decks, the birth of the microchip, the death of discrete circuitry, and the arrival of the download era.


Part technological treatise, part philosophical manifesto on the nature of artistic excellence and the overwhelming need for music, Soul Mining brings the reader viscerally inside the recording studio, where the surrounding forces have always been just as important as the resulting albums. Beyond skill, beyond record budgets, beyond image and ego, Lanois's work and music show the value of dedication and soul. His lifelong quest to find the perfect mixture of tradition and innovation is inimitable and unforgettable.",Daniel Lanois is one of the most respected and sought-after producers in the music industry. He has won eight Grammy Awards and is also well-known for his own music. He is currently in the band Black Dub.,"“This book is bursting with memorable anecdotes about [Lanois's] collaborators, another of the debut author's many gifts to fans of rock and country music.”—Kevin Canfield, San Francisco Chronicle

“The master musician and producer offers a typically idiosyncratic take on his life and art . . . Readers will savor the unique character of the producer's unconventional technique, which often employs setting up a jerry-rigged studio with vintage gear in an exotic locale. . . Lanois' book bursts with atmosphere and feeling. He is that rare breed, a lyrical technocrat, and he emerges from the work as one of music's most unusual and charismatic figures. There's really nothing like this oft-rapturous work in the canon of musical memoirs.”—Kirkus

“In his humble, self-effacing memoir of growing up poor in Canada, Lanois, born in a small Quebec town, describes the difficulties he faced . . .

In Heavy, he invites us to consider what it means to grow up in a nation obsessed with progress yet unwilling to reckon with its past.

Laymon writes with stunning honesty about his childhood as a headstrong Black son to a brilliant, complicated mother in Jackson, Mississippi. He chronicles his journey from early experiences of sexual violence through his college suspension to his eventual role as a young professor in New York. Throughout, he examines his complex relationships with his mother and grandmother, his struggles with anorexia and obesity, and his battles with sex, writing, and gambling.

By naming the secrets and lies he and his mother spent years avoiding, Laymon challenges himself, his family, and his readers to confront a terrifying possibility: that few people in America truly know how to love responsibly or want to bear the weight of genuine freedom. Heavy is both deeply personal and nationally illuminating—a defiant yet vulnerable exploration of weight, identity, family, and friendship.","Laymon's unflinching memoir traces his relationship with his brilliant mother while confronting trauma, addiction, and the weight of family secrets. A devastating examination of what it means to grow up Black in America.","Born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, Kiese Laymon is the Ottilie Schillig Professor in English and Creative Writing at the University of Mississippi.

""There are those rare writers in the world whose work unearths the stories that have been buried in and around us for so long. They force us to confront all that we would be rather not see, and ask us to reckon with why we have failed to see it for so long. Kiese Laymon is one such rare writer. Heavy is a memoir, yes, but it is also a testament to a sort of truth and self-reflection that is increasingly rare in our world today.

—Clint Smith, author of How the Word is Passed & Counting Descent

""Heavy is an act of truth telling unlike any other I can think of in American literature, partly due to Laymon's uniquely gifted mind—his ability to pursue the ways we lie to each other while also loving each other, or, not, and the humility he brings to bear while doing so, this consistently brings us back to life, to what matters in this world. Heavy is a gift to us, if we can pick it up—a moral exercise and an intimate history that is at the same time a story about America.""

—Alexander Chee, author of How to Write an Autobiographical Novel","In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.","Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.

In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.

A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.

Living with retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that gradually steals vision from the outside in, he's spent decades watching his world slowly shrink. What began as subtle changes in his teenage years has progressed to an inevitable conclusion—soon, he will likely be completely blind.

Rather than simply wait for that moment, Leland embarks on a fascinating journey of discovery. He dives deep into the rich culture, language, and politics of blindness, determined to understand not just the physical reality awaiting him, but the entire world he's about to enter. Along the way, he navigates shifting relationships with his wife and son, and grapples with his evolving sense of identity as he moves from mainstream life to one with disability.

Part memoir, part cultural investigation, this is Leland's refusal to merely survive his transition.

They left very different traces behind.

Using an amazing cache of little-studied material—including recently discovered documents, objects, and portraits—Jill Lepore brings Jane Franklin to life in a way that illuminates not only this remarkable woman but an entire world usually lost to history. Like her famous brother, Jane was a passionate reader, gifted writer, and shrewd political commentator. Unlike him, she was a mother of twelve.

Lepore's biography offers a strikingly original perspective on Benjamin Franklin while telling one of the great untold stories of American history: a wholly different account of the founding of the United States, seen through the eyes of a brilliant woman whose voice has been silent for centuries.","Jane Franklin was as brilliant as her famous brother Benjamin—a passionate reader, gifted writer, and shrewd political commentator.

Deeply researched and passionately written, it brings us inside a poignant relationship between two lovable people who seemed so different but were also so connected. I devoured this book and will treasure it.""

—Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs

""From scraps and whispers, Jill Lepore has resurrected Ben Franklin's youngest sister, the only relative who could truthfully say, ""Every line from him was a pleasure."" The subject is tailor-made for Lepore, as artful a writer as she is exact a scholar. She delivers two marvels at once: An authentic 18th century female voice, cheerful, inquisitive, and saucy, as well as an intimate portrait of Jane Franklin's revered brother himself.""

—Stacy Schiff, author of Cleopatra","From one of our most accomplished and widely admired historians, a revelatory portrait of Benjamin Franklin’s youngest sister and a history of history itself. Like her brother, Jane Franklin was a passionate reader, a gifted writer, and an astonishingly shrewd political commentator. Unlike him, she was a mother of twelve.","Benjamin Franklin, who wrote more letters to his sister than he wrote to anyone else, was the original American self-made man; his sister spent her life caring for her children. They left very different traces behind. Making use of an amazing cache of little-studied material, including documents, objects, and portraits only just discovered, Jill Lepore brings Jane Franklin to life in a way that illuminates not only this one woman but an entire world—a world usually lost to history. Lepore’s life of Jane Franklin, with its strikingly original vantage on her remarkable brother, is at once a wholly different account of the founding of the United States and one of the great untold stories of American history and letters: a life unknown.","Jill Lepore is the David Woods Kemper ’41 Professor of American History at Harvard University and professor of law at Harvard Law School. She is also a staff writer at The New Yorker. Her many books include the international bestseller These Truths: A History of the United States & Book of Ages. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","“Book of Ages is the name of Lepore’s extraordinary new book about Jane Franklin, but to call it simply a biography would be like calling Ben’s experiments with electricity mere kite flying….The end product is thrilling—an example of how a gifted scholar and writer can lift the obscure out of silence. In so doing, Lepore enriches our sense of everyday life and relationships and conversational styles in Colonial America….The brilliance of Lepore’s book is that plain Jane’s story becomes every bit as gripping—and, in its own way, important—as Big Ben’s public triumphs.”—Maureen Corrigan, NPR

His mother, Jane, is a famous feminist author; his father, Jonathan, is an expert at getting ""lost boys"" to open up.

Deftly shifting perspectives and time periods, The Topeka School is the story of a family navigating its struggles and strengths: Jane's reckoning with the legacy of an abusive father, Jonathan's marital transgressions, the challenge of raising a good son in a culture of toxic masculinity. It's also a riveting prehistory of our present moment—the collapse of public speech, the trolls and tyrants of the New Right, and the ongoing crisis of identity among white men.","Family drama meets cultural prophecy in this brilliant novel about a teenage debater in 1990s Kansas.

The real crash had taken place over the previous year in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn't shine and the SEC doesn't dare to tread: bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invented impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of Americans who couldn't pay their debts.

Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor. Instead of asking what went wrong, he asks: Who got it right? Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become and made billions from that perception? What qualities of character made these few persist when peers dismissed them as delusional?

—Andrew Leonard, Salon.com",The #1 New York Times bestseller: a brilliant account—character-rich and darkly humorous—of how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff.,"When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking.

The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar’s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles?

As existential threats mount—climate change, economic instability, the rise of an unnamed dictator, an epidemic of loneliness—she posts deeper into the portal's void.

—Jia Tolentino, author of Trick Mirror","A social media celebrity’s hyper-online life collides with a family crisis, forcing her to reckon with love and mortality. Surreal, hilarious, and deeply moving.","As this urgent, genre-defying book opens, a woman who has recently been elevated to prominence for her social media posts travels around the world to meet her adoring fans. She is overwhelmed by navigating the new language and etiquette of what she terms ""the portal,"" where she grapples with an unshakable conviction that a vast chorus of voices is now dictating her thoughts. When existential threats--from climate change and economic precariousness to the rise of an unnamed dictator and an epidemic of loneliness--begin to loom, she posts her way deeper into the portal's void. An avalanche of images, details, and references accumulate to form a landscape that is post-sense, post-irony, post-everything. ""Are we in hell?"" the people of the portal ask themselves. ""Are we all just going to keep doing this until we die?""

Suddenly, two texts from her mother pierce the fray: ""Something has gone wrong,"" and ""How soon can you get here?"" As real life and its stakes collide with the increasingly absurd antics of the portal, the woman confronts a world that seems to contain both an abundance of proof that there is goodness, empathy, and justice in the universe, and a deluge of evidence to the contrary.

Initially welcomed, these immigrants soon faced horrific racial terror as their numbers grew and economic downturns left white workers unemployed.

What followed was a series of increasingly harsh federal laws targeting Chinese laborers—marking the first time the United States banned people based solely on race. Michael Luo follows this community from these brutal early years to modern times, revealing how they persisted despite systematic persecution.

Luo chronicles early victims like Gene Tong, a Los Angeles herbalist lynched by a mob, and demagogues like Denis Kearney, who led the anti-Chinese movement. He also highlights pioneering activists like Wong Chin Foo, who fought for their community's rights. At the book's heart lies a shameful chapter: the violent expulsion of Chinese residents from towns across the American West, creating America's first undocumented immigrants—hounded, counted, and surveilled.

Only in 1965 did America's gates reopen to Asian immigrants like Luo's own parents. Drawing on extensive archives and written with a New Yorker writer's precision, this revelatory history examines how the ""stranger"" label persists even as over twenty-two million Asian Americans call this country home.","This sweeping history traces Chinese Americans' 150-year struggle against exclusion and violence, from Gold Rush persecution to modern-day belonging. New Yorker writer Michael Luo uncovers how America's first race-based immigration bans shaped our democracy—and why this story matters now.","Michael Luo is an executive editor at The New Yorker, writing on politics, religion, and Asian American issues. He joined the magazine in 2016 after thirteen years at the New York Times as metro reporter, national correspondent, and investigative reporter and editor. He's received a George Polk Award and a Livingston Award for Young Journalists.","""Strangers in the Land is what history should be--richly detailed, authoritative, and compelling. Luo pieces together the stunning and shocking story of a people's journey to this country, and in the process reveals an essential part of the story of America.""

—David Grann, New York Times-bestselling author of The Wager and Killers of the Flower Moon

""An epic of both the best and worst aspects of the American experiment, Strangers in the Land is a work of history that is deeply researched, deftly written, and highly relevant today. In the vivid, often heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring experiences of Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans, Luo finds a deeper story about aspiration and belonging that is as universal as it is profound.""

—Patrick Radden Keefe, New York Times-bestselling author of Say Nothing

""Tracing echoes of today's debates around immigration and exclusion to the past, Luo's vividly told, carefully researched, and deeply compassionate book is an essential contribution to the continually unfolding story of the Chinese in America.""

—Hua Hsu, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Stay True",From New Yorker writer Michael Luo comes a masterful narrative history of the Chinese in America that traces the sorrowful theme of exclusion and documents their more than century-long struggle to belong.,"Strangers in the Land tells the story of a people who, beginning in the middle of the nineteenth century, migrated by the tens of thousands to a distant land they called Gum Shan­––Gold Mountain. Americans initially welcomed these Chinese arrivals, but, as their numbers grew, horrific episodes of racial terror erupted on the Pacific coast. A prolonged economic downturn that idled legions of white workingmen helped create the conditions for what came next: a series of progressively more onerous federal laws aimed at excluding Chinese laborers from the country, marking the first time the United States barred a people based on their race. In a captivating debut, Michael Luo follows the Chinese from these early years to modern times, as they persisted in the face of bigotry and persecution, revealing anew the complications of our multiracial democracy.

    Luo writes of early victims of anti-Asian violence, like Gene Tong, a Los Angeles herbalist who was dragged from his apartment and hanged by a mob during one of the worst mass lynchings in the country’s history; of demagogues like Denis Kearney, a sandlot orator who became the face of the anti-Chinese movement in the late-1870s; of the pioneering activist Wong Chin Foo and other leaders of the Chinese community, who pressed their new homeland to live up to its stated ideals.  At the book’s heart is a shameful chapter of American history: the brutal driving out of Chinese residents from towns across the American West. The Chinese became the country’s first undocumented immigrants: hounded, counted, suspected, surveilled.

    In 1889, while upholding Chinese exclusion, Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field characterized them as “strangers in the land.” Only in 1965 did America’s gates swing open to people like Luo’s parents, immigrants from Taiwan. Today there are more than twenty-two million people of Asian descent in the United States and yet the “stranger” label, Luo writes, remains. Drawing on archives from across the country and written with a New Yorker writer’s style and sweep, Strangers in the Land is revelatory and unforgettable, an essential American story.","Michael Luo is an executive editor at The New Yorker and writes regularly for the magazine on politics, religion, and Asian American issues. He joined The New Yorker in 2016. Before that, he spent thirteen years at the New York Times, as a metro reporter, national correspondent, and investigative reporter and editor.

She has failed to give him a son and her sharp intelligence and audacious will alienate his old friends and the noble families of England. When the discarded Katherine dies in exile from the court, Anne stands starkly exposed, the focus of gossip and malice.

At a word from Henry, Thomas Cromwell is ready to bring her down. Over three terrifying weeks, Anne is ensnared in a web of conspiracy, while the demure Jane Seymour stands waiting her turn for the poisoned wedding ring. But Anne and her powerful family will not yield without a ferocious struggle. Hilary Mantel's Bring Up the Bodies follows the dramatic trial of the queen and her suitors for adultery and treason. To defeat the Boleyns, Cromwell must ally with his natural enemies, the papist aristocracy. What price will he pay for Anne's head?","Hilary Mantel was a renowned English writer who twice won the Booker Prize, for her best-selling novel Wolf Hall and its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies. The final novel of the Wolf Hall trilogy, The Mirror & the Light, debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and won worldwide critical acclaim. Mantel wrote seventeen celebrated books, including the memoir Giving Up the Ghost, and she was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction, the Walter Scott Prize, the Costa Book Award, the Hawthornden Prize, and many other accolades. In 2014, Mantel was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). She died at age seventy in 2022.","""Two years ago something astonishingly fair happened in the world of prestigious prizes: the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction for 2009 both went to the right winner. The book was Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, and it would have dwarfed the competition any year…It was a hard act to follow. But the follow-up is equally sublime…That ironic ending will be no cliffhanger for anyone even remotely familiar with Henry VIII’s trail of carnage. But in Bring Up the Bodies it works as one. The wonder of Ms. Mantel’s retelling is that she makes these events fresh and terrifying all over again.""—The New York Times

As her body is hastily buried, Thomas Cromwell breakfasts with the victors, the blacksmith's son from Putney emerging from the bloodbath to continue his relentless climb to power.

His master, Henry VIII, has already moved on to his third queen, Jane Seymore, who will die giving him the male heir he desperately craves. Cromwell has only his wits to rely on—no noble family, no private army. Yet despite rebellion at home, traitors abroad, and threats of invasion testing Henry's regime, Cromwell's imagination envisions a transformed England.

But can a nation shed its past like old skin? Do the dead refuse to stay buried? The Spanish ambassador poses a chilling question: What will you do when the king inevitably turns on you, as he does everyone who gets too close?

Mantel brings her magnificent trilogy to a triumphant close, tracing Cromwell's final years as he reaches the pinnacle of power. This is a defining portrait of predator and prey, a ferocious contest between past and present, royal will and common vision—of a modern nation forging itself through conflict and courage.","Thomas Cromwell reaches the height of his power in Henry VIII's court, but his meteoric rise makes his fall inevitable.

—The Washington Post","The final volume in Mantel’s Cromwell trilogy traces his rise to unparalleled power and his brutal fall. Majestic and immersive, it completes one of the great achievements of modern historical fiction.","England, May 1536. Anne Boleyn is dead, decapitated in the space of a heartbeat by a hired French executioner. As her remains are bundled into oblivion, Thomas Cromwell breakfasts with the victors. The blacksmith’s son from Putney emerges from the spring’s bloodbath to continue his climb to power and wealth, while his formidable master, Henry VIII, settles to short-lived happiness with his third queen before Jane dies giving birth to the male heir he most craves.

Cromwell is a man with only his wits to rely on; he has no great family to back him, no private army. Despite rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad and the threat of invasion testing Henry’s regime to the breaking point, Cromwell’s robust imagination sees a new country in the mirror of the future. But can a nation, or a person, shed the past like a skin? Do the dead continually unbury themselves? What will you do, the Spanish ambassador asks Cromwell, when the king turns on you, as sooner or later he turns on everyone close to him?

With The Mirror & the Light, Hilary Mantel brings to a triumphant close the trilogy she began with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. She traces the final years of Thomas Cromwell, the boy from nowhere who climbs to the heights of power, offering a defining portrait of predator and prey, of a ferocious contest between present and past, between royal will and a common man’s vision: of a modern nation making itself through conflict, passion, and courage.","Hilary Mantel was the author of the bestselling novel Wolf Hall and its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies, which both won the Booker Prize.

When María approaches the widow to offer condolences, she enters their world and meets another man who casts the crime in a disturbing new light. As she falls in love with him, the boundaries between observation and obsession blur dangerously.

Through María's narration, what begins as a murder mystery transforms into something far more complex—a metaphysical exploration of love and death, guilt and chance, and how we're haunted by loss. Marías crafts a brilliant meditation on the slippery nature of truth and the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of tragedy.","When the man María secretly observes at her local café is murdered, her fascination with his perfect life spirals into dangerous obsession.

Hidden in the woods, she watches the blaze until her neighbor Akhmed discovers her sitting in the snow.

Akhmed knows getting involved means risking his life. In a village where informers will do anything for a loaf of bread, there's no safe place to hide a child. But for reasons of his own, he sneaks her through the forest to an abandoned hospital where the sole remaining doctor, Sonja Rabina, treats the wounded.

Though Sonja protests that her hospital is not an orphanage, Akhmed convinces her to keep Havaa for a trial. Over five extraordinary days, Sonja's world shifts on its axis, revealing the intricate pattern of connections that weaves together the pasts of these three unlikely companions and unexpectedly decides their fate.

This is a majestic debut about love, loss, and the unexpected ties that bind us together in the most impossible circumstances.","When eight-year-old Havaa's father is taken and her house burned, a neighbor risks everything to hide her with a doctor in an abandoned hospital.

—The Atlantic","A “masterly” (The New York Times, Editors’ Choice), “riveting” (The Atlantic) novel of friendship, family, and the unthinkable realities of exile, from the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of The Return","One evening, as a young boy growing up in Benghazi, Khaled hears a bizarre short story read aloud on the radio, about a man being eaten alive by a cat, and has the sense that his life has been changed forever. Obsessed by the power of those words—and by their enigmatic author, Hosam Zowa—Khaled eventually embarks on a journey that will take him far from home, to pursue a life of the mind at the University of Edinburgh.

There, thrust into an open society that is miles away from the world he knew in Libya, Khaled begins to change. He attends a protest against the Qaddafi regime in London, only to watch it explode into tragedy. In a flash, Khaled finds himself injured, clinging to life, unable to leave Britain, much less return to the country of his birth. To even tell his mother and father back home what he has done, on tapped phone lines, would expose them to danger.

When a chance encounter in a hotel brings Khaled face-to-face with Hosam Zowa, the author of the fateful short story, he is subsumed into the deepest friendship of his life. It is a friendship that not only sustains him but eventually forces him, as the Arab Spring erupts, to confront agonizing tensions between revolution and safety, family and exile, and how to define his own sense of self against those closest to him.

A devastating meditation on friendship and family, and the ways in which time tests—and frays—those bonds, My Friends is an achingly beautiful work of literature by an author working at the peak of his powers.","Hisham Matar was born in New York City to Libyan parents, spent his childhood in Tripoli and Cairo, and has lived most of his life in London.

This desperate burst of violence sets off a chain reaction that ripples through the community in James McBride's funny, moving follow-up to his National Book Award-winning The Good Lord Bird.

As the story unfolds, the lives of these characters—caught in the tumultuous swirl of 1960s New York—overlap in unexpected ways.

—Entertainment Weekly","In 1969 Brooklyn, a boisterous church congregation finds its fate bound up with a mysterious old man who sells homemade moonshine. McBride delivers a raucous, big-hearted portrait of community, faith, and forgiveness, bursting with humor and soul.","In September 1969, a fumbling, cranky old church deacon known as Sportcoat shuffles into the courtyard of the Cause Houses housing project in south Brooklyn, pulls a .38 from his pocket, and, in front of everybody, shoots the project’s drug dealer at point-blank range.

The reasons for this desperate burst of violence and the consequences that spring from it lie at the heart of Deacon King Kong, James McBride’s funny, moving novel and his first since his National Book Award–winning The Good Lord Bird. In Deacon King Kong, McBride brings to vivid life the people affected by the shooting: the victim, the African-American and Latinx residents who witnessed it, the white neighbors, the local cops assigned to investigate, the members of the Five Ends Baptist Church where Sportcoat was deacon, the neighborhood’s Italian mobsters, and Sportcoat himself.

As the story deepens, it becomes clear that the lives of the characters—caught in the tumultuous swirl of 1960s New York—overlap in unexpected ways. When the truth does emerge, McBride shows us that not all secrets are meant to be hidden, that the best way to grow is to face change without fear, and that the seeds of love lie in hope and compassion.

Bringing to these pages both his masterly storytelling skills and his abiding faith in humanity, James McBride has written a novel every bit as involving as The Good Lord Bird and as emotionally honest as The Color of Water.

The truth behind this mystery lies buried in the secrets of Chicken Hill, a struggling neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side, sharing dreams and hardships.

At the heart of this community are Moshe and Chona Ludlow—he runs an integrated theater, she operates the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state threatens to institutionalize a deaf boy, Chona teams up with Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe's theater and unofficial leader of the Black community, to protect him.

McCracken delivers a sly meditation on grief, art, and the stories we tell to survive.","Ten months after her mother's death, a writer takes a trip to London—a city her mother adored. As she wanders the familiar streets, memories flood back, intertwining with uncertain thoughts about the future. Back in New England, the family home is up for sale, its contents already sorted through.

The daughter recalls everything that made her complicated mother extraordinary: her brilliant wit, fierce generosity, maddening obstinacy, and sheer determination to embrace life despite physical limitations. But she finds herself grappling with a painful question—how did her mother endure it all?

Though she wants to honor her mother's intense need for privacy, the writer wrestles with whether chronicling this remarkable life is an act of love or betrayal.

—The Boston Globe","A taut, groundbreaking new novel from bestselling and award-winning author Elizabeth McCracken, about a writer’s relationship with her larger-than-life mother—and about the very nature of writing, memory, and art","Ten months after her mother’s death, the narrator of The Hero of This Book takes a trip to London. The city was a favorite of her mother’s, and as the narrator wanders the streets, she finds herself reflecting on her mother’s life and their relationship. Thoughts of the past meld with questions of the future: back in New England, the family home is now for sale, its considerable contents already winnowed.

The woman, a writer, recalls all that made her complicated mother extraordinary—her brilliant wit, her generosity, her unbelievable obstinacy, her sheer will in seizing life despite physical difficulties—and finds herself wondering how her mother had endured. Even though she wants to respect her mother’s nearly pathological sense of privacy, the woman must come to terms with whether making a chronicle of this remarkable life constitutes an act of love or betrayal.

The Hero of This Book is a searing examination of grief and renewal, and of a deeply felt relationship between a child and her parents. What begins as a question of filial devotion ultimately becomes a lesson in what it means to write. At once comic and heartbreaking, with prose that delights at every turn, this is a novel of such piercing love and tenderness that we are reminded that art is what remains when all else falls away.","Elizabeth McCracken is the author of eight books, including The Hero of This Book, The Souvenir Museum (long-listed for the National Book Award), Bowlaway, Thunderstruck & Other Stories (winner of the 2014 Story Prize and long-listed for the National Book Award), and The Giant’s House (a National Book Award finalist).

She can't imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there's certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.

But then, there's this gorgeous girl on the train.

Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August's day when she needed it most. August's subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there's one big problem: Jane doesn't just look like an old school punk rocker. She's literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her.

""Part romance, part fantasy, this gorgeous novel is about meeting someone on your daily commute — a girl, it turns out, who has been riding the train since the 1970s, thanks to a magical timeslip. But it's also about loneliness, and being unmoored from normal time, and missing people you've lost, and dealing with generational trauma and fearing an unknowable future.""

—The New York Times

""McQuiston's joyful sophomore romp mixes all the elements that made Red, White & Royal Blue so outstanding—quirky characters, coming-of-age confusion, laugh-out-loud narration, and hilarious pop-cultural references—into something totally its own...With all the fun and camp of a drag show (of which this novel features more than one) but grounded in the tenderness of first love, this time-slip rom-com is an absolute delight.""

—Publishers Weekly","From the New York Times bestselling author of Red, White & Royal Blue comes a new romantic comedy that puts a queer spin on Kate & Leopold","For cynical twenty-three-year-old August, moving to New York City is supposed to prove her right: that things like magic and cinematic love stories don’t exist, and the only smart way to go through life is alone. She can’t imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there’s certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.

But then, there’s this gorgeous girl on the train.

Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August’s day when she needed it most. August’s subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there’s one big problem: Jane doesn’t just look like an old school punk rocker. She’s literally displaced in time from the 1970s, and August is going to have to use everything she tried to leave in her own past to help her. Maybe it’s time to start believing in some things, after all.

Casey McQuiston’s One Last Stop is a magical, sexy, big-hearted romance where the impossible becomes possible as August does everything in her power to save the girl lost in time.","Casey McQuiston is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of romantic comedies, including One Last Stop, I Kissed Shara Wheeler, and Red, White & Royal Blue, whose writing has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Bon Appetit.

Spring, 1849. Thirteen-year-old Eli McCullough—the first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas—watches a Comanche war band brutally murder his mother and sister before taking him captive. Brave and clever, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their language, earning his place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies, including white men.

Neither white nor Indian, civilized nor fully wild, he must carve a place for himself in a world where he doesn't fully belong—a journey that reverberates through generations. Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son Peter, who bears the emotional cost of his father's ruthless ambition, and his great-granddaughter JA, who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world.

Spring, 1849. The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli McCullough is thirteen years old when a marauding band of Comanche storm his homestead and brutally murder his mother and sister, taking him captive.

—Kirkus",A renowned historian traces the life of a single object handed down through three generations of Black women to craft a “deeply layered and insightful” (The Washington Post) testament to people who are left out of the archives.,"In 1850s South Carolina, an enslaved woman named Rose faced a crisis: the imminent sale of her daughter Ashley. Thinking quickly, she packed a cotton bag for her with a few items, and, soon after, the nine-year-old girl was separated from her mother and sold. Decades later, Ashley’s granddaughter Ruth embroidered this family history on the sack in spare, haunting language. 
 
Historian Tiya Miles carefully traces these women’s faint presence in archival records, and, where archives fall short, she turns to objects, art, and the environment to write a singular history of the experience of slavery, and the uncertain freedom afterward, in the United States. All That She Carried is a poignant story of resilience and love passed down against steep odds. It honors the creativity and resourcefulness of people who preserved family ties when official systems refused to do so, and it serves as a visionary illustration of how to reconstruct and recount their stories today.","Tiya Miles is the Michael Garvey Professor of History at Harvard University, a 2011 MacArthur Fellowship recipient, and the author of five prize-winning works, including the National Book Award–winning, best-selling All That She Carried.

""A beautiful novel, full of life and authenticity, atmosphere and characters that breathe.""

—Maureen Corrigan, NPR","At the turn of the 19th century, a Dutch clerk arrives in Japan to work for the East India Company, where he becomes enmeshed in politics, forbidden love, and cultural collision. Mitchell crafts a rich historical epic with lyrical precision.","The year is 1799, the place Dejima in Nagasaki Harbor, the “high-walled, fan-shaped artificial island” that is the Japanese Empire’s single port and sole window onto the world, designed to keep the West at bay; the farthest outpost of the war-ravaged Dutch East Indies Company; and a de facto prison for the dozen foreigners permitted to live and work there. To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, costly courtesans, earthquakes, and typhoons comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout and resourceful young clerk who has five years in the East to earn a fortune of sufficient size to win the hand of his wealthy fiancée back in Holland.

But Jacob’s original intentions are eclipsed after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor and midwife to the city’s powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully broken. The consequences will extend beyond Jacob’s worst imaginings. As one cynical colleague asks, “Who ain’t a gambler in the glorious Orient, with his very life?”

A magnificent mix of luminous writing, prodigious research, and heedless imagination, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet is the most impressive achievement of its eminent author.","David Mitchell is the author of the novels Ghostwritten, number9dream, Cloud Atlas, Black Swan Green, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, The Bone Clocks, and Slade House.

—NPR","From one of our boldest, most celebrated new literary voices, a shocking and tender novel about a young woman’s efforts to sustain a state of deep hibernation over the course of a year on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.","Our narrator should be happy, shouldn’t she? She’s young, thin, pretty, a recent Columbia graduate, works an easy job at a hip art gallery, lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan paid for, like the rest of her needs, by her inheritance. But there is a dark and vacuous hole in her heart, and it isn’t just the loss of her parents, or the way her Wall Street boyfriend treats her, or her sadomasochistic relationship with her best friend, Reva. It’s the year 2000 in a city aglitter with wealth and possibility; what could be so terribly wrong?

My Year of Rest and Relaxation is a powerful answer to that question. Through the story of a year spent under the influence of a truly mad combination of drugs designed to heal our heroine from her alienation from this world, Moshfegh shows us how reasonable, even necessary, alienation can be. Both tender and blackly funny, merciless and compassionate, it is a showcase for the gifts of one of our major writers working at the height of her powers.

Kennedy, founder of the twentieth century's most famous political dynasty. As the only biographer granted unrestricted access to the Kennedy papers, Nasaw tracks Kennedy's astonishing rise from East Boston outsider to supreme Washington insider.

Kennedy's limitless ambition drove his career to extraordinary heights—banker, World War I shipyard manager, Hollywood studio head, Wall Street operator, New Deal presidential adviser, and founding chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His astounding fall from grace came during World War II, when his antiwar stance as the first Irish American ambassador to London earned him White House ire and popular distaste.

This is also the story of the family Kennedy raised and the children who completed his journey. Of his many roles, father was most dear to him, though tragedies would mark his final years with unspeakable suffering.

Drawing on never-before-published materials from archives on three continents, Nasaw answers haunting questions about Kennedy's life and legacy, revealing a man who participated in the major events of his times—from the Depression and New Deal to two world wars and the birth of the New Frontier.","The definitive biography of Joseph P.

Kennedy and most definitely a man of parts... Exhaustive yet accessible, Nasaw's book illuminates.""

—Kirkus","Celebrated historian David Nasaw brings to life the story of Joseph Patrick Kennedy, in this, the first and only biography based on unrestricted and exclusive access to the Joseph P. Kennedy papers","In this magisterial new work The Patriarch, the celebrated historian David Nasaw tells the full story of Joseph P. Kennedy, the founder of the twentieth century's most famous political dynasty. Nasaw—the only biographer granted unrestricted access to the Joseph P. Kennedy papers in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library—tracks Kennedy's astonishing passage from East Boston outsider to supreme Washington insider. Kennedy's seemingly limitless ambition drove his career to the pinnacles of success as a banker, World War I shipyard manager, Hollywood studio head, broker, Wall Street operator, New Deal presidential adviser, and founding chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His astounding fall from grace into ignominy did not come until the years leading up to and following America's entry into the Second World War, when the antiwar position he took as the first Irish American ambassador to London made him the subject of White House ire and popular distaste.

The Patriarch is a story not only of one of the twentieth century's wealthiest and most powerful Americans, but also of the family he raised and the children who completed the journey he had begun. Of the many roles Kennedy held, that of father was most dear to him. The tragedies that befell his family marked his final years with unspeakable suffering.

The Patriarch looks beyond the popularly held portrait of Kennedy to answer the many questions about his life, times, and legacy that have continued to haunt the historical record. Was Joseph P. Kennedy an appeaser and isolationist, an anti-Semite and a Nazi sympathizer, a stock swindler, a bootlegger, and a colleague of mobsters? What was the nature of his relationship with his wife, Rose? Why did he have his daughter Rosemary lobotomized? Why did he oppose the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Korean War, and American assistance to the French in Vietnam? What was his relationship to J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI? Did he push his second son into politics and then buy his elections for him?

In this pioneering biography, Nasaw draws on never-before-published materials from archives on three continents and interviews with Kennedy family members and friends to tell the life story of a man who participated in the major events of his times: the booms and busts, the Depression and the New Deal, two world wars and a cold war, and the birth of the New Frontier. In studying Kennedy's life, we relive with him the history of the American Century.","David Nasaw is a historian, two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, and bestselling author of The Last Million, named a best book of the year by NPR, Kirkus Reviews, and History Today, and, according to The Economist, one of the ""six must-read books on the Second World War""; The Patriarch, a New York Times Five Best Non-Fiction Books of the Year; Andrew Carnegie, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and the winner of the New-York Historical Society's American History Book Prize; and The Chief, winner of the Bancroft Prize. He is the Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. Professor of History Emeritus at the CUNY Graduate Center and a past president of the Society of American Historians. In 2023, Nasaw was honored by the New York Public Library as a “Library Lion.” His father served in the Army Medical Corps in Eritrea during World War II.","“Riveting… The Patriarch is a book hard to put down…As his son indelibly put it some months before his father was struck down: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your county.’ One wonders what was going through the mind of the patriarch, sitting a few feet away listening to that soaring sentiment as a fourth-generation Kennedy became president of the United States. After coming to know him over the course of this brilliant, compelling book, the reader might suspect that he was thinking he had done more than enough for his country. But the gods would demand even more.”—Christopher Buckley, The New York Times

""A spellbinding book.""—Slate

""[A] sprawling, highly readable biography of the dynast and larger-than-life figure whose presence still haunts American political life... Working from his subject’s extensive archives, Nasaw (Andrew Carnegie, 2006, etc.) pieces together a sometimes-sympathetic, sometimes-critical view of Joseph P. Kennedy (1888–1969), father of John F. Kennedy and most definitely a man of parts... Exhaustive yet accessible, Nasaw’s book illuminates.""—Kirkus","Finalist — Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography (2013)

At its heart lies an intimate romance: Nelson's relationship with artist Harry Dodge, who is fluidly gendered.

Through candid accounts of falling in love and navigating pregnancy, Nelson creates a tender yet unflinching portrait of queer family-making. But this isn't just personal storytelling—Nelson channels the intellectual rigor of thinkers like Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, binding her lived experience to sharp analysis of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, marriage, and child-rearing.

The result is a fierce meditation on radical individual freedom and the transformative power of caretaking. Nelson dismantles conventional thinking while building something entirely new—a rallying cry for authenticity that's both deeply personal and universally resonant.","Nelson weaves memoir and theory into a stunning meditation on queer love, family-making, and identity. Perfect for readers who loved Ocean Vuong's vulnerability or anyone seeking fresh perspectives on what family can be.","Maggie Nelson is the author of The Argonauts, Bluets, Like Love, On Freedom, The Red Parts, and, most recently, Pathemata, Or, The Story of My Mouth.

No piety is safe, no orthodoxy, no easy irony. The scare quotes burn off like fog.""

—Ben Lerner, author of The Topeka School

""What a dazzlingly generous, gloriously unpredictable book! Maggie Nelson shows us what it means to be real, offering a way of thinking that is as challenging as it is liberating. She invites us to 'pay homage to the transitive' and enjoy 'a becoming in which one never becomes.' Reading The Argonauts made me happier and freer.""

―Eula Biss, author of Immunity

""It's Nelson's articulation of her many selves―the poet who writes prose; the memoirist who considers the truth specious; the essayist whose books amount to a kind of fairy tale, in which the protagonist goes from darkness to light, and then falls in love with a singular knight―that makes her readers feel hopeful.""

―Hilton Als, The New Yorker","An intrepid voyage out to the frontiers of the latest thinking about love, language, and family.","Maggie Nelson's The Argonauts is a genre-bending memoir, a work of ""autotheory"" offering fresh, fierce, and timely thinking about desire, identity, and the limitations and possibilities of love and language. At its center is a romance: the story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, is an intimate portrayal of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making.

Writing in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.","Maggie Nelson is the author of The Argonauts, Bluets, Like Love, On Freedom, The Red Parts, and, most recently, Pathemata, Or, The Story of My Mouth.

Bravo.""

—Tommy Orange, New York Times-bestselling author of There There","Continuing the story from The Sympathizer, this novel follows the unnamed narrator as he navigates the underworld of 1980s Paris. Nguyen blends crime, philosophy, and politics in a searing meditation on identity, exile, and revolution.","The long-awaited new novel from one of America’s most highly regarded contemporary writers, The Committed follows the unnamed Sympathizer as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon. The pair try to overcome their pasts and ensure their futures by engaging in capitalism in one of its purest forms: drug dealing.

Traumatized by his reeducation at the hands of his former best friend, Man, and struggling to assimilate into French culture, the Sympathizer finds Paris both seductive and disturbing. As he falls in with a group of left-wing intellectuals whom he meets at dinner parties given by his French Vietnamese “aunt,” he finds stimulation for his mind but also customers for his narcotic merchandise. But the new life he is making has perils he has not foreseen, whether the self-torture of addiction, the authoritarianism of a state locked in a colonial mindset, or the seeming paradox of how to reunite his two closest friends whose worldviews put them in absolute opposition. The Sympathizer will need all his wits, resourcefulness, and moral flexibility if he is to prevail.

Both literary thriller and novel of ideas, The Committed is a blistering portrayal of commitment and betrayal that will cement Viet Thanh Nguyen’s position in the firmament of American letters.","Viet Thanh Nguyen was born in Vietnam and raised in America. He is the author of The Sympathizer, which was awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction alongside seven other prizes.

While Orlean has always written her way into other people's lives, Joyride is her most personal book ever—a searching journey through finding her feet as a journalist, recovering from the collapse of her first marriage, falling in love again, becoming a mother while mourning her own mother's decline, and confronting mortality. It's also a time machine to journalism's bygone era, from her start in the golden age of alt-weeklies to working alongside icons like Robert Gottlieb, Tina Brown, and David Remnick.","Susan Orlean's most personal memoir yet takes us behind the scenes of her legendary journalism career. From profiling tiger owners to climbing Mt. Fuji, she reveals how curiosity and wonder fuel both great writing and a creative life.","Susan Orlean has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1992. She is the New York Times bestselling author of seven books, including The Library Book, Rin Tin Tin, Saturday Night, and The Orchid Thief, which was made into the Academy Award–winning film Adaptation. She lives with her family and animals in Los Angeles.","""Readers will love it; writers will learn from it . . . Orlean's anecdotes sing with the pleasure of a person born to her passion and purpose.""

""Brilliant . . . A high-spirited, exhilarating memoir.""

—Moira Hodgson, The Wall Street Journal","From Susan Orlean, the beloved New Yorker writer and bestselling author of The Orchid Thief and The Library Book who has been hailed as “a national treasure” by The Washington Post, comes a masterful memoir of finding her creative calling and purpose that invites us to approach life with wonder, curiosity, and an irrepressible sense of delight.","“The story of my life is the story of my stories,” writes Susan Orlean in this extraordinary, era-defining memoir from one of the greatest practitioners of narrative nonfiction of our time. Joyride is a magic carpet ride through Orlean’s life and career, where every day is an opportunity for discovery and every moment holds the potential for wonder. Throughout her storied career, her curiosity draws her to explore the most ordinary and extraordinary of places, from going deep inside the head of a regular ten-year-old boy for a legendary profile (“The American Man Age Ten”) to reporting on a woman who owns twenty-seven tigers, from capturing the routine magic of Saturday night to climbing Mt. Fuji.

Not only does Orlean’s account of a writing life offer a trove of indispensable gleanings for writers, it’s also an essential and practical guide to embracing any creative path. She takes us through her process of dreaming up ideas, managing deadlines, connecting with sources, chasing every possible lead, confronting writer’s block and self-doubt, and crafting the perfect lede—a Susan specialty.
While Orlean has always written her way into other people’s lives in order to understand the human experience, Joyride is her most personal book ever—a searching journey through finding her feet as a journalist, recovering from the excruciating collapse of her first marriage, falling head-over-heels in love again, becoming a mother while mourning the decline of her own mother, sojourning to Hollywood for films based on her work including Adaptation and Blue Crush, and confronting mortality. Joyride is also a time machine to a bygone era of journalism, from Orlean’s bright start in the golden age of alt-weeklies to her career-making days working alongside icons such as Robert Gottlieb, Tina Brown, David Remnick, Anna Wintour, Sonny Mehta, and Jonathan Karp—forces who shaped the media industry as we know it today.

Infused with Orlean’s signature warmth and wit, Joyride is a must-read for anyone who hungers to start, build, and sustain a creative life. Orlean inspires us to seek out daily inspiration and rediscover the marvels that surround us.

But when a crack appears at the bottom of the pool, they're cast out into an unforgiving world without comfort or relief.

One swimmer is Alice, who is slowly losing her memory. For her, the pool was a final stand against the darkness of encroaching dementia. Without the fellowship of other swimmers and her daily routine, she plunges into dislocation and chaos, swept into memories of childhood and the Japanese American incarceration camp where she spent the war.

Alice's estranged daughter, reentering her mother's life too late, witnesses her stark and devastating decline. What begins as a meditation on the rhythms of community becomes a profound exploration of memory, loss, and the fragile structures that hold our lives together.","When their community pool cracks and closes, regular swimmers lose more than exercise routines—especially Alice, facing dementia's onset.

—Chris Cleave, author of Little Bee and Incendiary","Parry investigates the disappearance and murder of Lucie Blackman in Tokyo, weaving a chilling account of crime, culture, and justice.","Lucie Blackman—tall, blond, twenty-one years old—stepped out into the vastness of Tokyo and disappeared forever. For months, the police’s only lead was a suspicious message left with Lucie’s best friend claiming she had joined a religious cult. The truth would prove much darker. Who was the mysterious man she had gone to meet? What exactly did Lucie do at her hostess job in the notorious Roppongi nightclub district? How many others had suffered—and will suffer—her same fate?

Richard Lloyd Parry, an award-winning foreign correspondent, covered Lucie’s case from the beginning. He tracked the story across four continents, earned the trust of her family and friends, won unique access to the Japanese detectives and legal system, and delved deep into the mind of the man accused in Lucie’s disappearance, Joji Obara—described by the judge as “unprecedented and extremely evil.”

The result is a book at once thrilling and revelatory, “a big, ambitious true crime book in the tradition of Norman Mailer’s The Executioner’s Song [and] Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood” (Kester Aspden, Esquire).",Richard Lloyd Parry is the Asia editor and Tokyo bureau chief of The Times (London) and the author of In the Time of Madness and People Who Eat Darkness.,"“[In People Who Eat Darkness], Mr. Parry finds his voice, and it's a sturdy one. His book becomes not merely an exemplary piece of reportage but a sustained and quietly profound work of moral inquiry as well. It becomes ominous in ways that go well beyond the calculated shock value of its cover . . . Mr. Parry writes exceedingly well . . . [and] People Who Eat Darkness is surprisingly soulful, especially in its portrait of Ms. Blackman . . . He's restored her to life in this vivid book.”—Dwight Garner, The New York Times

Trump, television has conquered America. In Audience of One, New York Times chief television critic James Poniewozik traces the history of TV and mass media from the Reagan era to today, explaining how a volcanic, camera-hogging antihero merged with America’s most powerful medium to become our forty-fifth president.

In the tradition of Neil Postman’s masterpiece Amusing Ourselves to Death, Audience of One shows how American media have shaped American society and politics, by interweaving two crucial stories. The first story follows the evolution of television from the three-network era of the 20th century, which joined millions of Americans in a shared monoculture, into today’s zillion-channel, Internet-atomized universe, which sliced and diced them into fractious, alienated subcultures. The second story is a cultural critique of Donald Trump, the chameleonic celebrity who courted fame, achieved a mind-meld with the media beast, and rode it to ultimate power.

Braiding together these disparate threads, Poniewozik combines a cultural history of modern America with a revelatory portrait of the most public American who has ever lived. Reaching back to the 1940s, when Trump and commercial television were born, Poniewozik illustrates how Donald became “a character that wrote itself, a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world, a simulacrum that replaced the thing it represented.” Viscerally attuned to the media, Trump shape-shifted into a boastful tabloid playboy in the 1980s; a self-parodic sitcom fixture in the 1990s; a reality-TV “You’re Fired” machine in the 2000s; and finally, the biggest role of his career, a Fox News–obsessed, Twitter-mad, culture-warring demagogue in the White House.

Poniewozik deconstructs the chaotic Age of Trump as the 24-hour TV production that it is, decoding an era when politics has become pop culture, and vice versa. Trenchant and often slyly hilarious, Audience of One is a penetrating and sobering review of the raucous, raging, farcical reality show—performed for the benefit of an insomniac, cable-news-junkie “audience of one”—that we all came to live in, whether we liked it or not.",An incisive cultural history that captures a fractious nation through the prism of television and the rattled mind of a celebrity president.,James Poniewozik has been the chief television critic of the New York Times since 2015.

These four, and five other strangers—each summoned in different ways by trees—are brought together in a last and violent stand to save the continent’s few remaining acres of virgin forest.

In his twelfth novel, National Book Award winner Richard Powers delivers a sweeping, impassioned novel of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of—and paean to—the natural world. From the roots to the crown and back to the seeds, The Overstory unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond, exploring the essential conflict on this planet: the one taking place between humans and nonhumans. There is a world alongside ours—vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.

The Overstory is a book for all readers who despair of humanity’s self-imposed separation from the rest of creation and who hope for the transformative, regenerating possibility of a homecoming.

René endures brutal hardship, oppressed by the very forest he's charged with clearing. Forced to marry a Mi'kmaw woman, his descendants live trapped between two conflicting cultures. But the crafty, ruthless Duquet escapes, becoming first a fur trader, then establishing a timber empire.

Proulx follows both families across three centuries as they travel throughout North America, Europe, China, and New Zealand under stunningly harsh conditions—facing rival attacks, accidents, disease, and cultural destruction. Generation after generation seizes what they can from what seems an infinite resource, until modern descendants confront the specter of ecological collapse.

—Anthony Doerr, Outside Magazine","From the Pulitzer Prize–­­winning author of The Shipping News and “Brokeback Mountain,” comes the New York Times bestselling epic about the demise of the world’s forests: “Barkskins is grand entertainment in the tradition of Dickens and Tolstoy…the crowning achievement of Annie Proulx’s distinguished career, but also perhaps the greatest environmental novel ever written” (San Francisco Chronicle).","In the late seventeenth century two penniless young Frenchmen, René Sel and Charles Duquet, arrive in New France. Bound to a feudal lord, a “seigneur,” for three years in exchange for land, they become wood-cutters—barkskins. René suffers extraordinary hardship, oppressed by the forest he is charged with clearing. He is forced to marry a Mi’kmaw woman and their descendants live trapped between two inimical cultures. But Duquet, crafty and ruthless, runs away from the seigneur, becomes a fur trader, then sets up a timber business. Proulx tells the stories of the descendants of Sel and Duquet over three hundred years—their travels across North America, to Europe, China, and New Zealand, under stunningly brutal conditions—the revenge of rivals, accidents, pestilence, Indian attacks, and cultural annihilation. Over and over again, they seize what they can of a presumed infinite resource, leaving the modern-day characters face to face with possible ecological collapse.

Proulx’s inimitable genius is her creation of characters who are so vivid—in their greed, lust, vengefulness, or their simple compassion and hope—that we follow them with fierce attention.

—Kirkus",Thomas Pynchon brings us to New York in the early days of the internet.,"It is 2001 in New York City, in the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11th. 

Maxine Tarnow runs a fine little fraud investigation business on the Upper West Side. All is ticking over nice and normal, until she starts looking into the finances of a computer-security firm and its billionaire geek CEO. She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with Hitler’s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, and an array of bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead. Foul play, of course.

Will perpetrators be revealed, forget about brought to justice? Will Maxine have to take the handgun out of her purse? Will Jerry Seinfeld make an unscheduled guest appearance? Will accounts secular and karmic be brought into balance?

For centuries, medicine has improvised with whatever's available: sculpting noses from brass, borrowing skin from frogs and hearts from pigs, crafting eye parts from jet canopies and breasts from petroleum by-products. Today, we're attempting to grow body parts from scratch using stem cells and 3D printers. But how are we doing? Are we there yet?

In Replaceable You, Mary Roach explores the remarkable advances and difficult questions prompted by our bodies' inevitable failings. When does a person decide they'd be better off with a prosthetic than their existing limb? Can a donated heart beat forever? Can an intestine substitute for a vagina?

Roach dives in with characteristic verve and infectious wit, traveling to a legendary Boston burn unit, a ""superclean"" xeno-pigsty in China, and a stem cell ""hair nursery"" in San Diego's tech hub. She talks with researchers and surgeons, amputees and ostomates, kidney printers and wearable organ designers. From spending time in a 1950s iron lung to crossing Mongolia with cataract surgeons, Roach immerses readers in the wondrous, improbable quest to build a new you.","Mary Roach takes readers on a wild journey through the past, present, and future of replacement body parts—from brass noses to 3D-printed kidneys.

—Tony Miksanek - Booklist","From the New York Times best-selling author of Stiff and Fuzz, a rollicking exploration of the quest to re-create the impossible complexities of human anatomy.","The body is the most complex machine in the world, and the only one for which you cannot get a replacement part from the manufacturer. For centuries, medicine has reached for what’s available—sculpting noses from brass, borrowing skin from frogs and hearts from pigs, crafting eye parts from jet canopies and breasts from petroleum by-products. Today we’re attempting to grow body parts from scratch using stem cells and 3D printers. How are we doing? Are we there yet?

In Replaceable You, Mary Roach explores the remarkable advances and difficult questions prompted by the human body’s failings. When and how does a person decide they’d be better off with a prosthetic than their existing limb? Can a donated heart be made to beat forever? Can an intestine provide a workable substitute for a vagina?

Roach dives in with her characteristic verve and infectious wit. Her travels take her to the OR at a legendary burn unit in Boston, a “superclean” xeno-pigsty in China, and a stem cell “hair nursery” in the San Diego tech hub. She talks with researchers and surgeons, amputees and ostomates, printers of kidneys and designers of wearable organs. She spends time in a working iron lung from the 1950s, stays up all night with recovery techs as they disassemble and reassemble a tissue donor, and travels across Mongolia with the cataract surgeons of Orbis International.

Irrepressible and accessible, Replaceable You immerses readers in the wondrous, improbable, and surreal quest to build a new you.","Mary Roach is the author of seven best-selling works of nonfiction, including Grunt, Stiff, and, most recently, Fuzz. Her writing has appeared in National Geographic and the New York Times Magazine, among other publications. She lives in California.","""Since she burst onto the scene with 2003’s Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, the science writer Mary Roach has been grossing readers out with curiosity, humanity — and alarming gusto. And we can’t look away."" -The New York Times

""This book is so good and it's on my list because it's right on topic with Gone Before Goodbye. Replaceable You by Mary Roach is all about how in the future, we will be able to replace every organ in our body that fails."" -Reese Witherspoon

Science writer Roach engagingly explores the past, present, and future of fabricated replacement body parts and regenerative medicine. She has previously penned books about the body, including Gulp (2013), and brings her distinctive nonfiction writing style, headlined by curiosity, enthusiasm, and lots of humor, to this subject, too. . . .

One day, Jonathan received the devastating call: Michael had suffered a serious psychotic break and was in the locked ward of a psychiatric hospital.

Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Michael was still battling delusions when he made an extraordinary leap from halfway house to Yale Law School. The New York Times featured him as a role model genius, he sold a memoir, and Ron Howard bought the film rights. But then Michael, trapped in an unshakeable paranoid fantasy, killed his girlfriend Carrie and became a front-page story of an entirely different sort.

Ava’s father, affectionately known as Chief Bigtree, is AWOL; and that leaves Ava, a resourceful but terrified thirteen, to manage ninety-eight gators and the vast, inscrutable landscape of her own grief.

That night, a twenty-one-year-old white supremacist walked into Bible study and murdered the church's charismatic pastor and eight worshippers. Though the shooter targeted Mother Emanuel—the first AME church in the South—to incite racial strife, he couldn't have anticipated what followed: an outpouring of forgiveness from victims' families and a reckoning with Charleston's deep-rooted divisions.

In Mother Emanuel, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Kevin Sack explores the inspiring history that brought the church to that tragic moment and the profound desecration committed in its fellowship hall. He reveals how African Methodism grew from the harshest American soil, and how Black suffering shaped forgiveness into both religious practice and survival tool.

Sack uses the church's story to trace the long arc of Black life in Charleston, where nearly half of enslaved Africans disembarked in North America and where the Civil War began. Through one congregation's journey, he chronicles a unique Christian practice—from its daring 1817 breakaway from white churches, through Civil War and Reconstruction traumas, to its critical role in the Civil Rights Movement and beyond.","The devastating history and remarkable resilience of Charleston's Mother Emanuel church, from its founding in 1817 through the 2015 massacre.

—Jonathan Eig, Pulitzer prize-winning author of King: A Life",A sweeping history of one of the nation’s most important African American churches and a profound story of courage and grace amid the fight for racial justice,"Few people beyond South Carolina’s Lowcountry knew of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston—Mother Emanuel—before the night of June 17, 2015, when a twenty-one-year-old white supremacist walked into Bible study and slaughtered the church’s charismatic pastor and eight worshippers. Although the shooter had targeted Mother Emanuel—the first AME church in the South—to agitate racial strife, he could not have anticipated the aftermath: an out­pouring of forgiveness from victims’ families and a reckoning with the divisions of caste that have afflicted Charleston and the South since the earliest days of European settlement.

In Mother Emanuel, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Kevin Sack explores the inspiring history that brought the church to that moment and the depth of the desecration committed in its fellowship hall. It reveals how African Methodism was cultivated from the harshest American soil, and how Black suffering shaped forgiveness into both a religious practice and a survival tool. Sack, who has written about race in his native South for more than four decades, uses the church’s history to trace the long arc of Black life in the city where nearly half of enslaved Africans dis­embarked in North America and where the Civil War began. Through the microcosm of one congregation, he explores the development of a unique practice of Christianity, from its daring breakaway from white churches in 1817, through the traumas of the Civil War and Reconstruction, to its critical role in the Civil Rights Movement and beyond.

At its core, Mother Emanuel is an epic account of persever­ance, not just of a congregation but of a people who withstood enslavement, Jim Crow, and all manner of violence with an unbending faith.","Kevin Sack is a veteran journalist who has written about national affairs for more than four decades and has been part of three Pulitzer Prize–winning teams.

With his trademark prose—wickedly funny, unsentimental, and exquisitely tuned—Saunders continues to challenge and surprise: Here is a collection of prismatic, resonant stories that encompass joy and despair, oppression and revolution, bizarre fantasy and brutal reality.

“Love Letter” is a tender missive from grandfather to grandson, in the midst of a dystopian political situation in the (not too distant, all too believable) future, that reminds us of our obligations to our ideals, ourselves, and one another. “Ghoul” is set in a Hell-themed section of an underground amusement park in Colorado and follows the exploits of a lonely, morally complex character named Brian, who comes to question everything he takes for granted about his reality. In “Mother’s Day,” two women who loved the same man come to an existential reckoning in the middle of a hailstorm. In “Elliott Spencer,” our eighty-nine-year-old protagonist finds himself brainwashed, his memory “scraped”—a victim of a scheme in which poor, vulnerable people are reprogrammed and deployed as political protesters. And “My House”—in a mere seven pages—comes to terms with the haunting nature of unfulfilled dreams and the inevitability of decay.

Justified as a humanitarian enterprise, the undertaking was to be systematic and rational, overseen by Washington's small but growing bureaucracy. But as the policy unfolded over the next decade, thousands of Native Americans died under the federal government's auspices, and thousands of others lost their possessions and homelands in an orgy of fraud, intimidation, and violence.

Drawing on firsthand accounts and voluminous federal records, Saunt's deeply researched book reveals how Indian Removal became national policy and describes the chaotic, deadly results of deporting 80,000 men, women, and children. This was not an inevitable chapter in U.S. expansion—it was a fiercely contested political act designed to secure new lands for slavery's expansion and consolidate southern power.

Indigenous peoples fought relentlessly against the policy, while many U.S. citizens insisted it betrayed the nation's values. When Congress passed the act by a razor-thin margin, it authorized one of the first state-sponsored mass deportations in the modern era. Saunt shows how white supremacy, corruption, and administrative incompetence created this debacle—and how its consequences still resonate today.","This unflinching examination of Indian Removal in the 1830s exposes how 80,000 Native Americans were forcibly deported in what became one of history's first state-sponsored mass deportations.

—Kirkus","A masterful and unsettling history of “Indian Removal,” the forced migration of Native Americans across the Mississippi River in the 1830s and the state-sponsored theft of their lands.","In May 1830, the United States formally launched a policy to expel Native Americans from the East to territories west of the Mississippi River. Justified as a humanitarian enterprise, the undertaking was to be systematic and rational, overseen by Washington’s small but growing bureaucracy. But as the policy unfolded over the next decade, thousands of Native Americans died under the federal government’s auspices, and thousands of others lost their possessions and homelands in an orgy of fraud, intimidation, and violence. Unworthy Republic reveals how expulsion became national policy and describes the chaotic and deadly results of the operation to deport 80,000 men, women, and children.

Drawing on firsthand accounts and the voluminous records produced by the federal government, Saunt’s deeply researched book argues that Indian Removal, as advocates of the policy called it, was not an inevitable chapter in U.S. expansion across the continent. Rather, it was a fiercely contested political act designed to secure new lands for the expansion of slavery and to consolidate the power of the southern states. Indigenous peoples fought relentlessly against the policy, while many U.S. citizens insisted that it was a betrayal of the nation’s values. When Congress passed the act by a razor-thin margin, it authorized one of the first state-sponsored mass deportations in the modern era, marking a turning point for native peoples and for the United States.

In telling this gripping story, Saunt shows how the politics and economics of white supremacy lay at the heart of the expulsion of Native Americans; how corruption, greed, and administrative indifference and incompetence contributed to the debacle of its implementation; and how the consequences still resonate today.","Claudio Saunt is the Richard B.

—The New York Times","For readers of Jonathan Franzen and Nathan Hill comes a haymaker of an American novel about a missing teenage boy, cases of fluid and mistaken identity, and the transformative power of boxing.","Austin, Texas: It’s the summer of 1998, and there’s a new face on the scene at Terry Tucker’s Boxing Gym. Sixteen-year-old Nathaniel Rothstein has never felt comfortable in his own skin, but under the tutelage of a swaggering, Haitian-born ex-fighter named David Dalice, he begins to come into his own. Even the boy’s slightly stoned uncle, Bob Alexander, who is supposed to be watching him for the summer, notices the change. Nathaniel is happier, more confident—tanner, even. Then one night he vanishes, leaving little trace behind.

Across the city, Charles Rex, now going simply by “X,” has been undergoing a teenage transformation of his own, trolling the phone sex hotline that his mother works, seeking an outlet for everything that feels wrong about his body, looking for intimacy and acceptance in a culture that denies him both. As a surprising and unlikely romance blooms, X feels, for a moment, like he might have found the safety he’s been searching for. But it's never that simple.

More than a decade later, Nathaniel’s uncle Bob receives a shocking tip, propelling him to open his own investigation into his nephew’s disappearance. The resulting search involves gymgoers past and present, including a down-on-his-luck twin and his opportunistic brother; a rookie cop determined to prove herself; and Alexis Cepeda, a promising lightweight, who crossed the US-Mexico border when he was only fourteen, carrying with him a license bearing the wrong name and face.

—Daily Beast","The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra, the last queen of Egypt.","Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.

She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second.

They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women.

Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.

Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost.

He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more, most of them teenage members of Norway's governing Labour Party.

In One of Us, journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent Oslo neighborhood, become a terrorist?

But things don’t work out quite as hoped. In search of a plan B, like countless writers before her Jane turns her desperate gaze to Hollywood. When she finagles a meeting with a hot young producer with a seven-figure deal to create “diverse content” for a streaming network, he seems excited to work with a “real writer” to create what he envisions as the greatest biracial comedy ever to hit the small screen. Things finally seem to be going right for Jane—until they go terribly wrong.

Funny, piercing, and page-turning, this is Senna’s most on-the-money novel yet.
","Danzy Senna is the bestselling author of six previous books, including Caucasia, New People, and most recently Colored Television. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, she teaches writing at the University of Southern California.
","“There is no one else who writes like Senna. In all her books she tackles so many different subjects, all the while telling a story with characters so real and compelling you never think about how many ideas are being developed, and discussed, only that you want to find out what happens next, and how the ideas and the characters and the story will coalesce, all the way up until the last page, when you won’t want it to have to end.""—Tommy Orange, The Guardian

""I couldn’t stop turning the pages, and only when it was all over did I realize what Senna had done. Addictive, hilarious and relatable, yes, but Colored Television is after something larger and more elusive, a very modern reckoning with the ambiguities triangulated by race, class, creativity and love. She nails it.""—Miranda July, author of All Fours and The First Bad Man

Serpell’s formally daring novel explores the fractures of trauma and the unreliability of narrative.","Cassandra Williams is twelve; her little brother Wayne is seven. One day, when they're alone together, there is an accident and Wayne is lost forever. His body is never recovered.

The missing boy cleaves the family with doubt. Their father leaves, starts another family elsewhere. But their mother can't give up hope and launches an organization dedicated to missing children.

As C grows older, she sees her brother everywhere: in bistros, airplane aisles, subway cars. Here is her brother's older face, the light in his eyes, the way he seems to recognize her, too. But it can't be, of course. Or can it?

Then one day, in another accident, C meets a man both mysterious and familiar, a man who is also searching for someone and for his own place in the world. His name is Wayne.

Serpell's remarkable novel captures the uncanny experience of grief, the way the past breaks over the present like waves in the sea. The Furrows is a bold exploration of memory and mourning that twists unexpectedly into a story of mistaken identity, double consciousness, and the wishful longing for reunion with those we've lost.","When a family tragedy leaves a brother missing, grief becomes a lifelong haunting.

When he was freed, he didn't go home to Boston or Beirut—where he lived—or to Oklahoma City, where his Lebanese-American family had settled. Instead, he returned to his great-grandfather's estate, a house he had begun rebuilding three years earlier.

“In braiding themselves together, The History of Sound’s stories generate the most ingenious and pleasing and moving evocation of New England, in all its seasonal and geographic variety. Over time—from 1696 to Radiolab—mysteries posed in one story are off-handedly addressed years later in another, protagonists become someone else’s minor character, and fates are meted out as each new narrative throws a crucial contextualizing light upon the other. Ben Shattuck is a devoted magpie: these stories celebrate the earth’s music and bounty, and remind us how diminished we are when severed from who and what we loved.”—Jim Shepard, author of The Book of Aron and Like You'd Understand, Anyway","Winner — Story Prize Spotlight Award (2024)

Shepard balances stark tragedy with piercing humanity in a story of resilience.","Aron is an engaging but troubled young boy whose family flees the German invasion from the Polish countryside into Warsaw, where they face mounting deprivation, disease, and persecution. To keep their families alive, Aron and a small group of children risk everything by smuggling contraband through the ghetto's quarantine walls, constantly hunted by blackmailers and Jewish, Polish, and German police—not to mention the Gestapo.

When Aron's family is finally torn away, he finds refuge with Janusz Korczak, a doctor celebrated throughout prewar Europe as a champion of children's rights who now runs the Warsaw orphanage under Nazi rule. Though Treblinka awaits them all, the question remains: can Aron escape as his mentor believes possible, and live to bear witness to these atrocities?

Jim Shepard masterfully crafts this child's-eye view of humanity's darkest chapter into something mesmerizing—sometimes unexpectedly comic, truly heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring. Aron's unforgettable voice will stay with readers long after the final page.","When young Aron's family is torn apart in the Warsaw ghetto, he's taken in by the renowned Dr. Janusz Korczak at his orphanage.

—Ron Charles, The Washington Post","The acclaimed National Book Award finalist—“one of the United States’ finest writers,” according to Joshua Ferris, “full of wit, humanity, and fearless curiosity”—now gives us a novel that will join the short list of classics about children caught up in the Holocaust.","Aron, the narrator, is an engaging if peculiar and unhappy young boy whose family is driven by the German onslaught from the Polish countryside into Warsaw and slowly battered by deprivation, disease, and persecution.

When his family is finally stripped away from him, Aron is rescued by Janusz Korczak, a doctor renowned throughout prewar Europe as an advocate of children’s rights who, once the Nazis swept in, was put in charge of the Warsaw orphanage.

Two-and-a-half years later, he lay dead on a Hawaiian beach after a violent conflict with native islanders. How did Cook—renowned for his respect for Indigenous peoples—come to such a brutal end?

Hampton Sides delivers a masterful account of Cook's final journey that both examines the explorer's complex legacy and provides a thrilling narrative of 18th-century exploration. Cook was celebrated for his exceptional seamanship, humane leadership, and scientific dedication. His previous expeditions mapped vast areas of the Pacific and established first European contact with numerous peoples, always with curiosity rather than judgment.

But this final voyage was different. Cook became unpredictable and violent, repeatedly endangering his crew and ordering brutal retaliation against native peoples for perceived theft. His secret orders—to chart and claim lands before Britain's rivals and discover the Northwest Passage—may explain this transformation. Cook's scientific mission served as the sharp edge of colonial expansion, with catastrophic consequences for Indigenous populations worldwide.

These tensions culminated in Hawaii, where Cook's initial peaceful landing gave way to exploitative treatment of locals, leading to the fatal encounter that ended his legendary career.","Hampton Sides delivers a masterful account of Captain Cook's final, fatal voyage to Hawaii in 1776.

—The Washington Post","A “thrilling and superbly crafted” (The Wall Street Journal) account of the most momentous voyage of the Age of Exploration, which culminated in Captain James Cook’s death in Hawaii, and left a complex and controversial legacy still debated to this day.","On July 12th, 1776, Captain James Cook, already lionized as the greatest explorer in British history, set off on his third voyage in his ship the HMS Resolution. Two-and-a-half years later, on a beach on the island of Hawaii, Cook was killed in a conflict with native Hawaiians. How did Cook, who was unique among captains for his respect for Indigenous peoples and cultures, come to that fatal moment?

Hampton Sides’ bravura account of Cook’s last journey both wrestles with Cook’s legacy and provides a thrilling narrative of the titanic efforts and continual danger that characterized exploration in the 1700s. Cook was renowned for his peerless seamanship, his humane leadership, and his dedication to science. On previous expeditions, Cook mapped huge swaths of the Pacific, including the east coast of Australia, and initiated first European contact with numerous peoples. He treated his crew well and endeavored to learn about the societies he encountered with curiosity and without judgment.

Yet something was different on this last voyage. Cook became mercurial, resorting to the lash to enforce discipline, and led his two vessels into danger time and again. Uncharacteristically, he ordered violent retaliation for perceived theft on the part of native peoples. This may have had something to do with his secret orders, which were to chart and claim lands before Britain’s imperial rivals could, and to discover the fabled Northwest Passage. Whatever Cook’s intentions, his scientific efforts were the sharp edge of the colonial sword, and the ultimate effects of first contact were catastrophic for Indigenous people around the world. The tensions between Cook’s overt and covert missions came to a head on the shores of Hawaii. His first landing there was harmonious, but when Cook returned after mapping the coast of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, his exploitative treatment of the Hawaiians led to the fatal encounter.

At once a ferociously-paced story of adventure on the high seas and a searching examination of the complexities and consequences of the Age of Exploration, THE WIDE WIDE SEA is a major work from one of our finest narrative nonfiction writers.","Hampton Sides is the author of The New York Times bestselling histories  On Desperate Ground, In the Kingdom of Ice, Hellhound on his Trail, Blood and Thunder, and Ghost Soldiers, which won the PEN USA Award for Nonfiction.

James Gordon Bennett, the eccentric and stupendously wealthy owner of The New York Herald, had recently captured the world's attention by dispatching Stanley to Africa to find Dr. Livingstone. Now he was keen to re-create that sensation on an even more epic scale. So he funded an official U.S. naval expedition to reach the Pole, choosing as its captain a young officer named George Washington De Long, who had gained fame for a rescue operation off the coast of Greenland. De Long led a team of 32 men deep into uncharted Arctic waters, carrying the aspirations of a young country burning to become a world power. On July 8, 1879, the USS Jeannette set sail from San Francisco to cheering crowds in the grip of ""Arctic Fever.""

The ship sailed into uncharted seas, but soon was trapped in pack ice. Two years into the harrowing voyage, the hull was breached. Amid the rush of water and the shrieks of breaking wooden boards, the crew abandoned the ship. Less than an hour later, the Jeannette sank to the bottom,and the men found themselves marooned a thousand miles north of Siberia with only the barest supplies. Thus began their long march across the endless ice—a frozen hell in the most lonesome corner of the world. Facing everything from snow blindness and polar bears to ferocious storms and frosty labyrinths, the expedition battled madness and starvation as they desperately strove for survival.

Convinced that womanhood would make his daughters morally weak, he imposed strict rules: long skirts and dresses, head wraps, no makeup, no jewelry, no opinions, no friends. A woman's highest virtue, he believed, was obedience.

While Safiya's mother remained loyal to her husband, she secretly gave her children the gift of books and poetry, which became Safiya's lifeline. Watching her mother struggle voicelessly under the weight of housework and rigid beliefs, Safiya increasingly turned to education as her tool for finding her voice and breaking free.

As Safiya's rebellion grows, so does her father's rage and paranoia, erupting in escalating violence. Her voice strengthens lyrically and poetically, setting her on an inevitable collision course with the man who raised her.

Rich in the language only a poet could evoke, How to Say Babylon is Sinclair's reckoning with a culture that nourished but ultimately sought to silence her—a universal story of finding power within patriarchy and a rare glimpse into the world of Rastafari.","Growing up under her father's militant Rastafarian beliefs in Jamaica, Safiya Sinclair fought against strict rules designed to keep her pure and obedient.

Perfect for readers who were moved by Educated and Born a Crime.","Safiya Sinclair was born and raised in Montego Bay, Jamaica. She is the author of the memoir How to Say Babylon, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and named one of the best books of 2023 by The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME, The Atlantic, and many others.

""Dazzling. Potent. Vital. A light shining on the path of self-deliverance.""

—Tara Westover, author of Educated","With echoes of Educated and Born a Crime, How to Say Babylon is the stunning story of the author’s struggle to break free of her rigid Rastafarian upbringing, ruled by her father’s strict patriarchal views and repressive control of her childhood, to find her own voice as a woman and poet.","Throughout her childhood, Safiya Sinclair’s father, a volatile reggae musician and militant adherent to a strict sect of Rastafari, became obsessed with her purity, in particular, with the threat of what Rastas call Babylon, the immoral and corrupting influences of the Western world outside their home. He worried that womanhood would make Safiya and her sisters morally weak and impure, and believed a woman’s highest virtue was her obedience.

In an effort to keep Babylon outside the gate, he forbade almost everything. In place of pants, the women in her family were made to wear long skirts and dresses to cover their arms and legs, head wraps to cover their hair, no make-up, no jewelry, no opinions, no friends. Safiya’s mother, while loyal to her father, nonetheless gave Safiya and her siblings the gift of books, including poetry, to which Safiya latched on for dear life. And as Safiya watched her mother struggle voicelessly for years under housework and the rigidity of her father’s beliefs, she increasingly used her education as a sharp tool with which to find her voice and break free. Inevitably, with her rebellion comes clashes with her father, whose rage and paranoia explodes in increasing violence. As Safiya’s voice grows, lyrically and poetically, a collision course is set between them.

How to Say Babylon is Sinclair’s reckoning with the culture that initially nourished but ultimately sought to silence her; it is her reckoning with patriarchy and tradition, and the legacy of colonialism in Jamaica. Rich in lyricism and language only a poet could evoke, How to Say Babylon is both a universal story of a woman finding her own power and a unique glimpse into a rarefied world we may know how to name, Rastafari, but one we know little about.","Safiya Sinclair was born and raised in Montego Bay, Jamaica.

These were the first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, still alive today though she died more than sixty years ago. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine, uncovered secrets of cancer and viruses, and helped lead to advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping.

Yet Henrietta remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Her family didn't learn of her ""immortality"" until twenty years after her death, when scientists began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. Though the cells generated enormous profits, her family never saw a cent.

Rebecca Skloot brilliantly connects the Lacks family story to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and legal battles over who controls our biological material.

Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent.

Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells?

She wasn’t even sure she wanted to be a mother. So why does Dorothy feel like a failure?

It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay.

Mrs. Eliza Touchet is the Scottish housekeeper—and cousin by marriage—of William Ainsworth, a once-famous novelist now in decline. She's lived with him for thirty years and has opinions about everything: literature, justice, abolitionism, class, and the facades she sees everywhere in England. She suspects her cousin has no real talent and believes his successful friend Charles Dickens is nothing more than a bully and moralist.

Meanwhile, Andrew Bogle grew up enslaved on Jamaica's Hope Plantation, knowing intimately that every lump of sugar comes at human cost. When he finds himself in London as star witness in a celebrated case of imposture, he understands his future depends on telling the right story.

The ""Tichborne Trial"" captivates Mrs. Touchet and all of England—a lower-class Australian butcher claims to be the rightful heir to a sizable estate and title. Is Sir Roger Tichborne who he says he is, or is he a fraud? In a world of hypocrisy and self-deception, deciding what's real proves complicated.

Mrs. Eliza Touchet is the Scottish housekeeper—and cousin by marriage—of a once-famous novelist, now in decline, William Ainsworth, with whom she has lived for thirty years.

Mrs. Touchet is a woman of many interests: literature, justice, abolitionism, class, her cousin, his wives, this life and the next. But she is also sceptical. She suspects her cousin of having no talent; his successful friend, Mr. Charles Dickens, of being a bully and a moralist; and England of being a land of facades, in which nothing is quite what it seems.

Andrew Bogle, meanwhile, grew up enslaved on the Hope Plantation, Jamaica. He knows every lump of sugar comes at a human cost. That the rich deceive the poor. And that people are more easily manipulated than they realize. When Bogle finds himself in London, star witness in a celebrated case of imposture, he knows his future depends on telling the right story.

The “Tichborne Trial”—wherein a lower-class butcher from Australia claimed he was in fact the rightful heir of a sizable estate and title—captivates Mrs. Touchet and all of England.

As word spreads, an eclectic group of neighbors and friends gathers around the house, drawn by curiosity and concern.

The story unfolds through four distinct perspectives: Anna, a woman in her forties; Mark, a man in his sixties; May, a woman in her eighties; and ten-year-old Brooke. The twist? None of these narrators knows Miles more than slightly. Through their eyes, we piece together fragments of a stranger's life and motivations.

Smith transforms this absurd premise into a profound meditation on human connection. How much can we truly know about the people around us? What are the consequences of our fleeting daily interactions? With trademark wit, wordplay, and audacious storytelling, she explores our need for separation—from our pasts and each other—while revealing the redemptive possibilities that emerge when strangers' lives unexpectedly intersect.","When a dinner guest locks himself in an upstairs room and won't come out, four virtual strangers become unlikely witnesses to his breakdown.

Smith’s witty, thought-provoking novel explores identity, absurdity, and connection.","At a dinner party in the posh London suburb of Greenwich, Miles Garth suddenly leaves the table midway through the meal, locks himself in an upstairs room, and refuses to leave. An eclectic group of neighbors and friends slowly gathers around the house, and Miles’s story is told from the points of view of four of them: Anna, a woman in her forties; Mark, a man in his sixties; May, a woman in her eighties; and a ten-year-old named Brooke. The thing is, none of these people knows Miles more than slightly. How much is it possible for us to know about a stranger? And what are the consequences of even the most casual, fleeting moments we share every day with one another?

Brilliantly audacious, disarmingly playful, and full of Smith’s trademark wit and puns, There but for the is a deft exploration of the human need for separation—from our pasts and from one another—and the redemptive possibilities for connection. It is a tour de force by one of our finest writers.

""Against the alternating currents of boosterism and doom-speak so often associated with California, Susan Straight's Mecca focuses on the people who don't usually appear in literary and cinematic depictions of a place so big it could be a country. A heartbreaker from beginning to end, Mecca both shocks and moves in its powerful and unrelenting portrait of this sunny, fiery state.""

—Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of The Sympathizer and The Committed","From the National Book Award finalist Susan Straight, a stunning epic tracing the intertwined lives of native Californians fighting for life and land.","Johnny Frias has California in his blood. A descendant of the state’s Indigenous people and Spanish settlers, he has Southern California’s forgotten towns and canyons in his soul. He spends his days working for the California Highway Patrol pulling over speeders, ignoring their racist insults, and pushing past the trauma of his rookie year, when he killed a man who was in the midst of assaulting a young woman named Bunny, who proceeded to run away. But like the Santa Ana winds, which every year bring risk of fire, Johnny’s moment of action twenty years ago sparks a slow-burning chain of connections that unites a vibrant, complex cast of characters in ways they never saw coming.

In Mecca, the celebrated novelist Susan Straight crafts an unforgettable American epic, examining race, history, family, and destiny through the interlocking stories of a group of native Californians all gasping for air. With sensitivity, furor, and a cinematic scope that captures California in all its injustice, history, and glory, she tells a story of the American West through the eyes of the people who built it—and continue to sustain it. As the stakes get higher and the intertwined characters in Mecca slam against barrier after barrier, we find that when push comes to shove, it’s always better to push back.","Susan Straight has published nine novels, including Mecca, A Million Nightingales, and Highwire Moon, and one memoir, In the Country of Women. She’s been a finalist for the Kirkus Prize, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the National Book Award, among other honors, and received the Lannan Prize, the O. Henry Award, the Edgar Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement from the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes. Her fiction has been translated into ten languages. She was born in Riverside, California, where she lives with her family.
","""Susan Straight writes like a dream. In Mecca the landscapes and the passions of California come vividly and unforgettably to life, adding another triumph to her oeuvre, and one more gift to the literature of the West. Once again, Straight shines a light on the people at the margins of our seemingly prosperous country, illuminating their lives with her boundless empathy.""—Héctor Tobar, author of Deep Down Dark & The Last Great Road Bum

In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her marriage crumbled. Four years later, with nothing left to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State.

She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than ""an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise."" But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.

Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and crushing loneliness of the trail. Told with suspense and sparkling humor, Wild vividly captures the terrors and unexpected pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that nearly broke her—but ultimately healed her.","Sometimes the only way forward is to walk.

During her grueling three-month journey, Strayed circled around black bears and rattlesnakes, fought extreme dehydration by drinking oily gray pond water, and hiked in boots made entirely of duct tape.  Reading her matter-of-fact take on love and grief and the soul-saving quality of a Snapple lemonade, you can understand why Strayed has earned a cult following as the author of Dear Sugar, a popular advice column on therumpus.net. . . . With its vivid descriptions of beautiful but unforgiving terrain, Wild is a cinematic story, but Strayed's book isn't really about big, cathartic moments. The author never 'finds herself' or gets healed. When she reaches the trail's end, she buys a cheap ice cream cone and continues down the road. . . . It's hard to imagine anything more important than taking one step at a time. That's endurance, and that's what Strayed understands, almost 20 years later. As she writes, 'There was only one [option], I knew. To keep walking.""

""In the summer of 1995, at age 26 and feeling at the end of her rope emotionally, Strayed resolved to hike solo the Pacific Crest Trail . . . In this detailed, in-the-moment re-enactment, she delineates the travails and triumphs of those three grueling months. Living in Minneapolis, on the verge of divorcing her husband, Strayed was still reeling from the sudden death four years before of her mother; the ensuing years formed an erratic, confused time 'like a crackling Fourth of July sparkler.' Hiking the trail helped decide what direction her life would take, even though she had never seriously hiked or carried a pack before. . . . Eventually she began to experience 'a kind of strange, abstract, retrospective fun,' meeting the few other hikers along the way, all male; jettisoning some of the weight from her pack and burning books she had read; and encountering all manner of creature and acts of nature, from rock slides to snow. Her account forms a charming, intrepid trial by fire, as she emerges from the ordeal bruised but not beaten, changed, a lone survivor.""

Woefully underprepared for the wilderness, out of shape and carrying a ridiculously overweight pack, the author set out from the small California town of Mojave, toward a bridge ('the Bridge of the Gods') crossing the Columbia River at the Oregon-Washington border. Strayed's writing admirably conveys the rigors and rewards of long-distance hiking. Along the way she suffered aches, pains, loneliness, blistered, bloody feet and persistent hunger.

Stuart’s raw, tender debut is a portrait of poverty, love, and resilience.","Shuggie Bain tells the unforgettable story of young Hugh ""Shuggie"" Bain, a sweet and lonely boy navigating his 1980s childhood in run-down public housing in Glasgow, Scotland. Thatcher's policies have devastated the working class, leaving fathers and sons unemployed while the city's drug epidemic looms.

Shuggie's mother Agnes is both his guiding light and greatest burden. She dreams of a house with its own front door, flicking through catalogs and ordering small luxuries on credit to brighten her grey existence. Married to a philandering taxi driver, Agnes maintains her pride through appearance—her beehive, makeup, and pearly-white false teeth creating the glamorous image of a Glaswegian Elizabeth Taylor.

But beneath the surface, Agnes finds solace in drink, draining the family's weekly benefits on cans of extra-strong lager hidden in handbags and poured into tea mugs. As her older children escape, Shuggie remains to care for her through binges and brief periods of sobriety. Meanwhile, he struggles to become the ""normal"" boy he longs to be, though everyone recognizes he is ""no right""—harboring a secret that all but him can see.

This heartbreaking debut captures a working-class family rarely seen in fiction, exploring addiction, sexuality, and the complicated nature of love.","Set in 1980s Glasgow, this follows young Shuggie caring for his glamorous but alcoholic mother Agnes.

""I'm really, really stunned by it. It's so good. I think it's the best first book I've read in many years . . . It's a heartbreaking story, and quite hard to read at times, but it's almost like it's uplifting on behalf of literature. And it's written with great warmth and compassion for the characters.""

—Karl Ove Knausgaard, The Guardian","A stunning debut novel by a masterful writer telling the heart-wrenching story of a young boy and his alcoholic mother, whose love is only matched by her pride.","Shuggie Bain is the unforgettable story of young Hugh “Shuggie” Bain, a sweet and lonely boy who spends his 1980s childhood in run-down public housing in Glasgow, Scotland. Thatcher’s policies have put husbands and sons out of work, and the city’s notorious drugs epidemic is waiting in the wings.

Shuggie’s mother Agnes walks a wayward path: she is Shuggie’s guiding light but a burden for him and his siblings. She dreams of a house with its own front door while she flicks through the pages of the Freemans catalogue, ordering a little happiness on credit, anything to brighten up her grey life. Married to a philandering taxi-driver husband, Agnes keeps her pride by looking good—her beehive, make-up, and pearly-white false teeth offer a glamorous image of a Glaswegian Elizabeth Taylor. But under the surface, Agnes finds increasing solace in drink, and she drains away the lion’s share of each week’s benefits—all the family has to live on—on cans of extra-strong lager hidden in handbags and poured into tea mugs. Agnes’s older children find their own ways to get a safe distance from their mother, abandoning Shuggie to care for her as she swings between alcoholic binges and sobriety. Shuggie is meanwhile struggling to somehow become the normal boy he desperately longs to be, but everyone has realized that he is “no right,” a boy with a secret that all but him can see. Agnes is supportive of her son, but her addiction has the power to eclipse everyone close to her—even her beloved Shuggie.

A heartbreaking story of addiction, sexuality, and love, Shuggie Bain is an epic portrayal of a working-class family that is rarely seen in fiction.

The book gives a vivid glimpse of a marginalized, impoverished community in a bygone era of British history.

“This year’s breakout debut . . . It has drawn comparisons to D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Frank McCourt.”—Alexandra Alter, The New York Times

“I’m really, really stunned by it. It’s so good. I think it’s the best first book I’ve read in many years . . .

With the gonzo energy of Hunter S. Thompson and the sharp insight of Joan Didion, Sullivan brings his own laid-back, erudite Southern charm to show us how we really live now.

Sullivan's journey spans from his native Kentucky, where he introduces us to Constantine Rafinesque, a nineteenth-century polymath who invented a fantastical prehistory of the New World, to a Christian rock festival in the Ozarks. He travels to Florida to meet alumni and refugees of MTV's Real World, who've created their own self-perpetuating economy of minor celebrity, and across the South following the trail of the blues.

He investigates the formative years of Michael Jackson and Axl Rose in Indiana, then heads to the Gulf Coast in Katrina's wake—and returns as residents confront the BP oil spill. Through these seemingly disparate adventures, a unifying narrative emerges: a story about America we've never heard told this way. It's a fun-house mirror tour that reveals who we are in ways we never imagined, leaving us torn between laughter and tears.",Sullivan's razor-sharp essays dissect American culture from Christian rock festivals to MTV reality stars with the perfect blend of humor and insight.

Simultaneously channeling the gonzo energy of Hunter S. Thompson and the wit and insight of Joan Didion, Sullivan shows us-with a laidback, erudite Southern charm that's all his own-how we really (no, really) live now.

In his native Kentucky, Sullivan introduces us to Constantine Rafinesque, a nineteenth-century polymath genius who concocted a dense, fantastical prehistory of the New World. Back in modern times, Sullivan takes us to the Ozarks for a Christian rock festival; to Florida to meet the alumni and straggling refugees of MTV's Real World, who've generated their own self-perpetuating economy of minor celebrity; and all across the South on the trail of the blues. He takes us to Indiana to investigate the formative years of Michael Jackson and Axl Rose and then to the Gulf Coast in the wake of Katrina-and back again as its residents confront the BP oil spill.

Gradually, a unifying narrative emerges, a story about this country that we've never heard told this way. It's like a fun-house hall-of-mirrors tour: Sullivan shows us who we are in ways we've never imagined to be true.

His final words—""I can't breathe,"" repeated eleven times—were captured in a disturbing video seen by millions. In an era of contested police killings of African Americans, this case seemed clear-cut, yet the officer was never indicted.

The story runs far deeper than those few minutes of video. Garner was a larger-than-life figure—father and dreamer, black market entrepreneur and neighborhood fixture—whose rocky journey through life eventually narrowed to a single point: a Staten Island corner where he sold loose cigarettes.

The police department he encountered had its own troubled history of bad policy, perverse incentives, and an uncertain mission, all shadowed by racial control's dominant role in American policing. Taibbi masterfully weaves together Garner's vivid story—his family, his corner, and how policing policy shaped his life—with the dramatic tale of his killing and the circus that followed, leading to an urgent question: what job have we given our police, and who suffers when they do it?","Matt Taibbi delivers devastating investigative journalism about Eric Garner's life and death, exposing how broken policing policies create tragedy.

In an era of contested police killings of African Americans, this case seemed to be the clearest cut of all—and yet the officer was never even indicted for Garner’s death.

","Theo Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend.

At 71, Theroux brings decades of African experience to this deeply personal expedition, traveling by car, truck, and dugout canoe through landscapes both breathtaking and heartbreaking.

Along the way, he encounters a continent in transition—from the lingering scars of apartheid in South Africa to the oil-rich chaos of Angola, still recovering from decades of civil war. Theroux's unflinching eye captures both the resilience of ordinary people and the failures of aid organizations and governments. He visits remote villages, bustling markets, and forgotten border towns, always searching for authentic human connection.

This isn't just another travel memoir—it's a meditation on aging, privilege, and what it means to be a perpetual outsider. Theroux grapples with his own limitations as an aging white traveler while celebrating the enduring spirit of Africa. Raw, honest, and beautifully written, this journey becomes both a farewell to a beloved continent and a powerful reflection on a lifetime of wandering.","Legendary travel writer Paul Theroux's final African odyssey takes him from Cape Town to Angola's remote regions.

Now juggling doctoral studies and work as an EMS responder, he encounters people from his past and potential future during hospital shifts—including contemporaries of his estranged father, who's serving time for the statutory rape of Joseph's then-teenage mother.

Meanwhile, Joseph and his best friend Ray, a fellow veteran, bond over and wrestle with their shared wartime experience. They're caught in cycles of desire, heartbreak, and obligation as they navigate their return home.

Balancing single fatherhood, academic work, and endless hospital shifts, Joseph finds himself growing unexpectedly closer to his father. He attempts to articulate his lived understanding of sociopolitical struggles as both participant and observer, often clashing with the assumptions of friends and colleagues. This powerful debut examines everyday Black life—exploring health and sexuality, race and punishment, and the complicated gaps between our desires and our politics.","When an Iraq War veteran navigates single fatherhood, doctoral studies, and EMS work while confronting his complicated relationship with his incarcerated father, every shift brings new revelations.

—Ann Patchett, People","The exclusive, official story of the survival, faith, and family of Chile’s thirty-three trapped miners","When the San José mine collapsed outside of Copiapó, Chile, in August 2010, it trapped thirty-three miners beneath thousands of feet of rock for a record-breaking sixty-nine days. The entire world watched what transpired above-ground during the grueling and protracted rescue, but the saga of the miners' experiences below the Earth's surface--and the lives that led them there--has never been heard until now.

For Deep Down Dark, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Héctor Tobar received exclusive access to the miners and their tales. These thirty-three men came to think of the mine, a cavern inflicting constant and thundering aural torment, as a kind of coffin, and as a church where they sought redemption through prayer. Even while still buried, they all agreed that if by some miracle any of them escaped alive, they would share their story only collectively. Héctor Tobar was the person they chose to hear, and now to tell, that story.

The result is a masterwork or narrative journalism--a riveting, at times shocking, emotionally textured account of a singular human event. Deep Down Dark brings to haunting, tactile life the experience of being imprisoned inside a mountain of stone, the horror of being slowly consumed by hunger, and the spiritual and mystical elements that surrounded working in such a dangerous place. In its stirring final chapters, it captures the profound way in which the lives of everyone involved in the disaster were forever changed.","Héctor Tobar is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and a novelist.

It's spring 1976, and though she's been married for decades with two teenage children, her ties to Ireland remain stronger than those binding her to America.

Then a stranger appears at her door with devastating news: his pregnant wife is carrying Tony's child, and when the baby is born, he plans to leave it on Eilis's doorstep rather than raise it himself. This shocking revelation forces Eilis to confront the life she's carefully constructed and the choices that brought her here.

What Eilis decides to do—and refuses to do—in response to this crisis drives Tóibín's riveting exploration of marriage, loyalty, and the weight of the past. As secrets unravel and family dynamics shift, Eilis must navigate between the competing claims of duty and desire, forgiveness and revenge.","Twenty years after Brooklyn, Eilis faces her most impossible choice yet when a stranger reveals her husband's devastating secret.

—The Washington Post","The Nobel Prize–winner’s richest, most sweeping and ambitious novel yet follows the comet-like rise and fall of a mysterious, messianic religious leader as he blazes his way across eighteenth-century Europe.","In the mid-eighteenth century, as new ideas—and a new unrest—begin to sweep the Continent, a young Jew of mysterious origins arrives in a village in Poland. Before long, he has changed not only his name but his persona; visited by what seem to be ecstatic experiences, Jacob Frank casts a charismatic spell that attracts an increasingly fervent following. In the decade to come, Frank will traverse the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires with throngs of disciples in his thrall as he reinvents himself again and again, converts to Islam and then Catholicism, is pilloried as a heretic and revered as the Messiah, and wreaks havoc on the conventional order, Jewish and Christian alike, with scandalous rumors of his sect’s secret rituals and the spread of his increasingly iconoclastic beliefs. The story of Frank—a real historical figure around whom mystery and controversy swirl to this day—is the perfect canvas for the genius and unparalleled reach of Olga Tokarczuk.

—Mary Karr, author of The Liars' Club, Cherry & Lit","A chillingly personal and exquisitely wrought memoir of a daughter reckoning with the brutal murder of her mother at the hands of her former stepfather, and the moving, intimate story of a poet coming into her own in the wake of a tragedy","t age nineteen, Natasha Trethewey had her world turned upside down when her former stepfather shot and killed her mother. Grieving and still new to adulthood, she confronted the twin pulls of life and death in the aftermath of unimaginable trauma and now explores the way this experience lastingly shaped the artist she became.

With penetrating insight and a searing voice that moves from the wrenching to the elegiac, Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Natasha Trethewey investigates this profound experience of pain, loss, and grief as an entry point into understanding the tragic course of her mother’s life and the way her own life has been shaped by a legacy of fierce love and resilience. Moving through her mother’s history in the deeply segregated South and through her own girlhood as a “child of miscegenation” in Mississippi, Trethewey plumbs her sense of dislocation and displacement in the lead-up to the harrowing crime that took place on Memorial Drive in Atlanta in 1985.

Memorial Drive is a compelling and searching look at a shared human experience of sudden loss and absence but also a piercing glimpse at the enduring ripple effects of white racism and domestic abuse. Animated by unforgettable prose and inflected by a poet’s attention to language, this is a luminous, urgent, and visceral memoir from one of our most important contemporary writers and thinkers.","Natasha Trethewey is a former US poet laureate and the author of five collections of poetry, as well as a book of creative nonfiction.

It's 1961 in the quiet Dutch province of Overijssel. Bomb craters have been filled, buildings reconstructed, and the war is truly over. Living alone in her late mother's country home, Isabel knows her life is as it should be—led by routine and discipline.

But everything changes when her brother Louis brings his graceless new girlfriend Eva, leaving her at Isabel's doorstep as a guest for the season. Eva is Isabel's antithesis: she sleeps late, walks loudly through the house, and touches things she shouldn't. In response, Isabel develops a fury-fueled obsession.

In the sweltering peak of summer, her paranoia gives way to infatuation, leading to a discovery that unravels everything she's ever known.

Van der Wouden has produced the rare novel about World War II, the Holocaust, and their aftermath that succeeds in feeling fully, intimately human. . . .

“Quietly remarkable. . . . Van der Wouden’s writing is fine and taut. She lasers in on details, and presents unsentimental and intrinsically powerful metaphors. . . . I would have liked this book in any case, just for the pleasure of reading it.

Now, in Under the Skin, Villarosa exposes the deep-rooted forces in American healthcare and society that cause Black people to ""live sicker and die quicker"" compared to their white counterparts. Today's medical texts and instruments still carry slavery-era assumptions that Black bodies are fundamentally different from white bodies. Study after study shows worse treatment and outcomes for Black patients in medical settings.

Villarosa reveals how Black communities face environmental racism, living in dirtier, more polluted areas due to government neglect.

Gloriously inventive and constantly surprising, Beautiful Ruins weaves together romance, comedy, and heartbreak as flawed yet utterly relatable people reach toward impossible dreams.

Somewhere on a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks out over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea—blue as his eyes—and sees a vision: a slender blonde woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat.

While sixteen-year-old Rye yearns for a steady job and a home, his dashing older brother Gig dreams of a better world, fighting alongside other union men for fair pay and decent treatment. Enter Ursula the Great, a vaudeville singer who performs with a live cougar, and who introduces the brothers to a far more dangerous creature: a wealthy mining magnate who will stop at nothing to keep his wealth and his hold on Ursula.

—Publishers Weekly",A memoir that examines rural poverty and the lingering strains of racism in the south by the prize-winning author of Salvage the Bones.,"In five years, Jesmyn Ward lost five young men in her life--to drugs, accidents, suicide, and the bad luck that can follow people who live in poverty, particularly black men. Dealing with these losses, one after another, made Jesmyn ask the question: Why? And as she began to write about the experience of living through all the dying, she realized the truth--and it took her breath away. Her brother and her friends all died because of who they were and where they were from, because they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle that fostered drug addiction and the dissolution of family and relationships. Jesmyn says the answer was so obvious she felt stupid for not seeing it. But it nagged at her until she knew she had to write about her community, to write their stories and her own.

Jesmyn grew up in poverty in rural Mississippi. She writes powerfully about the pressures this brings, on the men who can do no right and the women who stand in for family in a society where the men are often absent. She bravely tells her story, revisiting the agonizing losses of her only brother and her friends. As the sole member of her family to leave home and pursue higher education, she writes about this parallel American universe with the objectivity distance provides and the intimacy of utter familiarity. A brutal world rendered beautifully, Jesmyn Ward's memoir will sit comfortably alongside Edwidge Danticat's Brother, I'm Dying, Tobias Wolff's This Boy's Life, and Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.","Jesmyn Ward received her MFA from the University of Michigan and has received the MacArthur Genius Grant, a Stegner Fellowship, a John and Renee Grisham Writers Residency, the Strauss Living Prize, and the 2022 Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.

Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home.","Tara Westover is an American historian and memoirist. Her first book, Educated, debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and remained on the list, in hardcover, for more than two years. The book, a memoir of her upbringing in rural Idaho, was a finalist for a number of national awards, including the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. To date it has been translated into more than forty-five languages. The New York Times named Educated one of the 10 Best Books of 2018, and the American Booksellers Association voted Educated the Nonfiction Book of the Year. For her staggering impact, Time named Westover one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2019. Westover holds a PhD in intellectual history from Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 2019 she was the Rosenthal Writer in Residence at Harvard University. In 2023, she was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Biden.","“Heart-wrenching . . . a beautiful testament to the power of education to open eyes and change lives.”—Amy Chua, The New York Times

—Publishers Weekly",The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Warmth of Other Suns examines the unspoken caste system that has shaped America and shows how our lives today are still defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.,"Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Isabel Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.","Isabel Wilkerson, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Humanities Medal, is the author of the critically acclaimed New York Times bestseller The Warmth of Other Suns, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction and was named to Time’s 10 Best Nonfiction Books of the 2010s and The New York Times Magazine’s list of the best nonfiction books of all time. She has taught at Princeton, Emory, and Boston Universities and has lectured at more than two hundred other colleges and universities across the United States and in Europe and Asia.","“This book has the reverberating and patriotic slap of the best American prose writing. . . . Wilkerson has written a closely argued book that largely avoids the word ‘racism,’ yet stares it down with more humanity and rigor than nearly all but a few books in our literature. . . .

—Boston Globe",A razor-sharp new collection of stories of visionary childhood misfits and struggling adult dreamers from this legendary writer of “perfectly indescribable fiction . . . To read Williams is to look into the abyss.,"“Night was best, for, as everyone knows, but does not tell, the sobbing of the earth is most audible at night.” “Men are but unconscious machines and they perform their cruelties so effortlessly.” “Caring was a power she’d once possessed but had given up freely.” The sentences of Joy Williams are like no other—the coiled wit, the sense of a confused and ruined landscape, even the slight chortle of hope that lurks between the words—for the scrupulous effort of telling, in these eleven stories, has a ravishing beauty that belies their substance. We meet lost souls like the twin-sister heiresses of a dirty industrial fortune in “After the Haiku Period,” who must commit a violent act in recompense for their family's deeds; in “Nettle,” a newly grown man who still revolves in a dreamscape of his childhood boarding-school innocence; the ghost of George Gurdieff, on an obsessive visit to the Arizona birthplace of the shining Susan Sontag; the “pelican child” who lives with the bony, ill-tempered Baba Yaga in a little hut on chicken legs. 

All of these characters insist on exploring, often at their peril, an indifferent and caustic world: they struggle against our degradation of the climate, of each other, and of honest human experience (“I try to relate only to what is immediately verifiable,” says one narrator ruefully), possibly in vain.

In this sanctuary, Saint nurtures her grand experiment—a truly free community where her people can flourish without fear. But as decades pass, Saint's conjuring and memories begin to fail her, leaving the town exposed to dangerous newcomers with their own supernatural abilities.

As cracks appear in Saint's creation, residents begin questioning whether their protected community might be just another form of captivity.

Is it genuine or is it yet another Fang performance piece? Early on in the novel, we’re told that the strange art the Fangs create has been glowingly described by critics as “choreographed spontaneity.” Wilson might as well have been writing a review for his own strange and wonderful novel, for The Family Fang indeed reads as a work of “choreographed spontaneity” that will linger in your mind long after the mall has closed and the mess in the restaurant has been cleaned up.”—NPR

In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected Siberia.

Among Humboldt's most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature as a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone. He predicted human-induced climate change, discovered similarities between climate and vegetation zones on different continents, and had a remarkable ability to fashion poetic narrative out of scientific observation.

Andrea Wulf brings this forgotten giant back into focus, exploring his relationships with iconic figures like Simón Bolívar and Thomas Jefferson, and examining how his writings inspired Darwin, Wordsworth, and Goethe. She makes the compelling case that Humboldt's influence led John Muir to his ideas of natural preservation and shaped Thoreau's Walden.

Among Humboldt’s most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone.

Now Andrea Wulf brings the man and his achievements back into focus: his daring expeditions and investigation of wild environments around the world and his discoveries of similarities between climate and vegetation zones on different continents. She also discusses his prediction of human-induced climate change, his remarkable ability to fashion poetic narrative out of scientific observation, and his relationships with iconic figures such as Simón Bolívar and Thomas Jefferson. Wulf examines how Humboldt’s writings inspired other naturalists and poets such as Darwin, Wordsworth, and Goethe, and she makes the compelling case that it was Humboldt’s influence that led John Muir to his ideas of natural preservation and that shaped Thoreau’s Walden.

With this brilliantly researched and compellingly written book, Andrea Wulf shows the myriad fundamental ways in which Humboldt created our understanding of the natural world, and she champions a renewed interest in this vital and lost player in environmental history and science.","Andrea Wulf was born in India and moved to Germany as a child. She is the author of Founding Gardeners, Brother Gardeners, and the New York Times best seller The Invention of Nature, which has been published in twenty-seven languages and won fifteen international literary awards. Wulf has written for many newspapers and magazines, including The New York Times, The Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic. She is a member of PEN America and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She lives in London.","“Andrea Wulf is a writer of rare sensibilities and passionate fascinations. I always trust her to take me on unforgettable journeys through amazing histories of botanical exploration and scientific unfolding. Her work is wonderful, her language sublime, her intelligence unflagging.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, bestselling author of The Signature of All Things and Big Magic

“Wulf (Chasing Venus) makes an impassioned case for the reinstatement of the boundlessly energetic, perpetually curious, prolific polymath von Humboldt (1769–1859) as a key figure in the history of science. . . . Wulf’s stories of wilderness adventure and academic exchange flow easily, and her affection for von Humboldt is contagious.”—Publishers Weekly

Instead, she accepts that as a given, and wisely so, for the best of them plainly are...Expansive and entertaining...Dozens of Literary Gamers will cherish the world she’s lovingly conjured. Meanwhile, everyone else will wonder what took them so long to recognize in video games the beauty and drama and pain of human creation.""—Tom Bissell, The New York Times

""A tour de force... A moving demonstration of the blended power of fiction and gaming....Zevin describes herself as 'a lifelong gamer.' That level of experience could very well have produced a story of hermetically sealed nostalgia impenetrable to anyone who doesn’t still own a copy of 'Space Invaders.' But instead, she’s written a novel that draws any curious reader into the pioneering days of a vast entertainment industry too often scorned by bookworms. And with the depth and sensitivity of a fine fiction writer, she argues for the abiding appeal of the flickering screen.""—Ron Charles, The Washington Post

“Whatever its subject, when a novel is powerful enough, it transports us readers deep into worlds not our own. That's true of Moby Dick, and it's certainly true of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, which renders the process of designing a great video game as enthralling as the pursuit of that great white whale….There are…smart ruminations here about cultural appropriation, given that the game, Ichigo, is inspired by Japanese artist Hokusai's famous painting The Great Wave at Kanagawa….It's a big, beautifully written novel about an underexplored topic, that succeeds in being both serious art and immersive entertainment.”—Maureen Corrigan, NPR","Winner — Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction (2022)

But unlike Hilton's peaceful monks, this Shangri-La was home to Stone Age warriors rumored to be headhunters and cannibals.

The pleasure tour became a desperate fight for survival when the plane crashed. Only three passengers survived: WAC Corporal Margaret Hastings, Lieutenant John McCollom, and Sergeant Kenneth Decker. Emotionally devastated and severely injured, they faced certain death in the wet jungle climate, vulnerable to disease, parasites, and poisonous snakes.

Caught between hostile tribes and enemy Japanese forces, with nothing but candy and their own courage, the trio made a harrowing trek down the mountainside into unknown territory. Their journey led them straight to a primitive tribe who had never seen white people.

Drawn from personal interviews, declassified documents, and original footage, Zuckoff reveals how the survivors traversed dense jungle to find help, how Filipino-American paratroopers risked everything to save them, and how they found protection with a noble native chief.","When a WWII sightseeing flight crashes in uncharted New Guinea jungle, three survivors must navigate Stone Age tribes and enemy territory.

—Kirkus",Zuckoff tells the incredible true story of a WWII plane crash in New Guinea and the survivors’ fight for rescue in uncharted jungle.,"On May 13, 1945, twenty-four officers and enlisted men and women stationed on what was then Dutch New Guinea boarded a transport plane named the Gremlin Special for a sightseeing trip over “Shangri-La.” A beautiful and mysterious valley surrounded by steep, jagged mountain peaks deep within the island’s uncharted jungle, this hidden retreat was named after the fabled paradise in the bestselling novel Lost Horizon. But unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton’s book, this Shangri-La was the home of Stone Age warriors—spear-carrying tribesmen rumored to be headhunters and cannibals.

But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers survived—WAC Corporal Margaret Hastings, Lieutenant John McCollom, and Sergeant Kenneth Decker. Margaret, barefoot and burned, had no choice but to wear her dead best friend’s shoes. McCollom, grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the Gremlin Special, masked his grief with stoicism. Decker, too, was severely burned and suffered a bloody, gaping head wound.

Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to disease, parasites, and poisonous snakes in the wet jungle climate, the trio faced certain death unless they left the wreckage. Caught between man-eating headhunters and the enemy Japanese, with nothing to sustain them but a handful of candy and their own fortitude, they endured a harrowing trek down the mountainside—an exhausting journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man--or woman.

Drawn from personal interviews, declassified Army documents, personal photos and mementos, a daily journal kept between the crash and the rescue effort, and original film footage, Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio—dehydrated, sick, and in pain—traversed the dense jungle foliage to find help; how a brave band of Filipino-American paratroopers, led by a dogged captain, risked their own lives to save the survivors; how the Americans would be protected by and eventually befriend a noble native chief and his people; and how a cowboy colonel was willing to risk a previously untried rescue mission to get them out.

A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying, enlightening, and comic, Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end.","Mitchell Zuckoff is the author of eight previous works of nonfiction, including the #1 New York Times bestseller 13 Hours, as well as Frozen in Time and Lost in Shangri-La.
