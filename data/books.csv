9780812993547,Between the World and Me,Notes on the First 150 Years in America,"In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful framework for understanding our nation's current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of ""race,"" a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and today threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion.

Between the World and Me is Coates's attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. He shares the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children's lives were taken as American plunder.

Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and emotionally charged reportage, this work illuminates the past, confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for moving forward.","Coates writes to his teenage son about inhabiting a Black body in America, weaving personal narrative with historical analysis. A searing meditation on race that illuminates four centuries of American history through one father's urgent, necessary reckoning.",176,,Biography & Autobiography / Memoirs,One World,14/07/2015,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"Ta-Nehisi Coates is the author of The Beautiful Struggle, We Were Eight Years in Power, The Water Dancer, and Between the World and Me, which won the National Book Award in 2015. He is the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship and lives in New York City with his wife and son.","""I've been wondering who might fill the intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died. Clearly it is Ta-Nehisi Coates. The language of Between the World and Me, like Coates's journey, is visceral, eloquent, and beautifully redemptive. And its examination of the hazards and hopes of black male life is as profound as it is revelatory. This is required reading.""

—Toni Morrison

""Ta-Nehisi Coates is the James Baldwin of our era, and this is his cri de coeur. A brilliant thinker at the top of his powers, he has distilled four hundred years of history and his own anguish and wisdom into a prayer for his beloved son and an invocation to the conscience of his country.""

—Isabel Wilkerson, author of Caste & The Warmth of Other Suns

""Brilliant . . . a riveting meditation on the state of race in America . . .

Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father. Thus begins their dangerous journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive promise of the Free States.

While many elements from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain—floods and storms, unexpected death and treasure along the river's banks, encounters with the Duke and Dauphin—Jim's agency, intelligence, and compassion emerge in radically new light. No longer a supporting character, Jim becomes the brilliant, complex protagonist driving this reimagined classic.

Brimming with Everett's electrifying humor and lacerating observations, James transforms American literature's most problematic friendship into something far more honest and profound.","Everett reimagines Huckleberry Finn from Jim's perspective, transforming literature's most problematic friendship into something honest and profound.

He studies his Black grandfather, Pop, but other figures complicate his understanding: his absent White father Michael, who's being released from prison; his White grandfather Big Joseph, who won't acknowledge his existence; and memories of his dead uncle Given, who died as a teenager.

Jojo's mother Leonie is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister's lives. She's an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her—Black, with a White partner, wanting to be better but unable to put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother that only come when she's high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances.

When Michael is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. There, another thirteen-year-old boy appears—the ghost of a dead inmate who carries the ugly history of the South with him.

Through intimate portraits of tenants and landlords, he reveals how eviction has become a business model—and how housing instability traps families in cycles of poverty.

Desmond spent months living in Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods, documenting the daily reality of families facing impossible choices: pay rent or buy food, keep the heat on or avoid eviction. His reporting transforms abstract statistics into human stories, showing how the lack of affordable housing ripples through every aspect of life—from children's education to parents' ability to find work.

Hailed as ""wrenching and revelatory"" by The Nation and ""vivid and unsettling"" by the New York Review of Books, Evicted transforms our understanding of poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving one of America's most devastating problems. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible.","Following eight Milwaukee families through eviction court and precarious rentals, Desmond shows how housing instability isn't just a symptom of poverty—it's a cause.

Part family drama, part social essay, part picaresque novel, at its heart it is the story of a father, a son, and the country they both call home.

Ayad Akhtar forges a new narrative voice to capture a country where debt has ruined countless lives and the gods of finance rule, where immigrants live in fear, and where the nation's unhealed wounds wreak havoc around the world. Through the lens of one family's story—from a heartland town in America to palatial suites in Central Europe to guerrilla lookouts in the mountains of Afghanistan—Akhtar attempts to make sense of it all, sparing no one, least of all himself, in the process.","From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author comes a genre-bending work that follows an immigrant father and son searching for belonging in post-Trump America.

9780385521314,Say Nothing,A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland,"Jean McConville's abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it.

In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress—with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.

Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by violent guerrilla war, whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of a united Ireland, left wondering whether their killings were justified acts of war or simple murders.

From radical terrorists like Dolours Price, planting bombs in London while barely out of her teens, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games of the British Army and Gerry Adams, who negotiated peace but betrayed hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past—Say Nothing conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.","Using one notorious killing as its foundation, Keefe excavates the brutal history of the Troubles and its lasting wounds.

At a word from Henry, Thomas Cromwell is ready to bring her down. Over three terrifying weeks, Anne becomes ensnared in a web of conspiracy, while the demure Jane Seymour waits her turn for the poisoned wedding ring. But Anne and her powerful family will not yield without a ferocious struggle.

But at what cost have they acquired their immense fortune? This is the mystery at the center of Bonds, a successful 1937 novel that all of New York seems to have read. Yet there are other versions of this tale of privilege and deceit.

Wilkerson tells this sweeping story through the lives of three unforgettable protagonists: Ida Mae Gladney, a sharecropper's wife who in 1937 fled Mississippi for Chicago; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 left Florida for Harlem; and Robert Foster, a surgeon who departed Louisiana in 1953 hoping to make it in California.

Wilkerson brilliantly captures their treacherous cross-country journeys by car and train and their new lives in unfamiliar territory. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people portrayed, this book transforms an ""unrecognized immigration"" within our own land into a deeply human story of courage, loss, and hope.","Through three deeply personal stories, Wilkerson transforms the Great Migration into intimate human drama.

9780802125088,The Yellow House,A Memoir,"In 1961, Sarah M. Broom's mother Ivory Mae bought a shotgun house in the promising neighborhood of New Orleans East and built her world inside it. It was the height of the Space Race, and the neighborhood housed a major NASA plant—postwar optimism seemed assured. Widowed, Ivory Mae remarried Sarah's father Simon Broom, and their combined family would eventually number twelve children. But after Simon died six months after Sarah's birth, the Yellow House would become Ivory Mae's thirteenth and most unruly child.

Broom's ambitious memoir tells a hundred years of her family's relationship to home in a neglected area of one of America's most mythologized cities. This is the story of a mother's struggle against a house's entropy, and of a daughter who left home only to reckon with its pull—even after Hurricane Katrina wiped the Yellow House off the map. Located in the gap between the ""Big Easy"" of tourist guides and the New Orleans where Broom was raised, this transformative memoir explores place, class, race, and the seeping rot of inequality with startling clarity and power.","A transformative memoir about family, place, and the inexorable pull of home, centered on a shotgun house in New Orleans East.

Physician and reporter Sheri Fink reconstructs five harrowing days when exhausted caregivers faced impossible choices about who to save first—and who to leave behind.

In the chaos of evacuation, certain patients were designated last for rescue. Months later, several doctors and nurses faced criminal allegations that they had deliberately hastened deaths by injecting patients with lethal doses of drugs.

The culmination of six years of meticulous reporting, Five Days at Memorial unravels the mystery of what really happened during those desperate hours. Fink draws readers into a hospital fighting for survival while exposing the hidden ethical dilemmas of end-of-life care and our dangerous unpreparedness for large-scale disasters.

Elena and Lila first met amid the shambles of postwar Italy—one brilliant and bookish, the other fiery and uncontainable.

By this final volume, life's great discoveries have been made and its losses suffered. Both women once fought to escape their Naples neighborhood. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. But now she has returned to Naples to be with the man she has always loved.

Lila never succeeded in freeing herself from the city. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Yet somehow, this proximity to a world she has always rejected only brings her role as unacknowledged leader into sharper relief.

This spans his transition from the extraordinary power he wielded as Senate Majority Leader to the humiliating powerlessness of serving as Vice President in an administration that disdained him, and finally to the presidency thrust upon him by an assassin's bullet.

By 1958, Johnson was maneuvering for the presidency, known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his time and the greatest Senate Leader in American history.

The first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, they're still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years.

HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine, uncovered secrets of cancer and viruses, and helped lead to advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping.

9780066211312,Just Kids,An Autobiography,"It was the summer Coltrane died, the summer of love and riots, and the summer when a chance encounter in Brooklyn led two young people on a path of art, devotion, and initiation.

Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his provocative vision toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-Second Street, eventually reaching the celebrated round table of Max's Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court.

In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and entered a community of the famous and infamous—the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by mutual dreams, they would sustain one another during the hungry years.

Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy—a portrait of two young artists' ascent and a salute to New York City's rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions.",Smith's memoir chronicles her extraordinary friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe during their bohemian years in 1970s New York. A tender portrait of young artists finding their voices amid the city's creative chaos.,304,,Biography & Autobiography / Music,Ecco,19/01/2010,Patti Smith,"Patti Smith is the author of the National Book Award winner Just Kids, as well as Woolgathering, M Train, Year of the Monkey, and Collected Lyrics. Her seminal album Horses has been hailed as one of the top 100 albums of all time. In 2005, the French Ministry of Culture awarded Smith the title of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres. Inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Smith is also the recipient of the ASCAP Founders Award, Sweden's Polar Music Prize, the PEN/Audible Literary Service Award, and the Legion d'honneur.","""Tenderly evocative...it makes perfect sense for [Smith] to use a memoirist's sleight of hand...to recapture an eager, fervent and wondrously malleable young spirit. It also makes sense for her to cast off all verbal affectation and write in a strong, true voice unencumbered by the polarizing mannerisms of her poetry.""

—Janet Maslin, The New York Times

""Just Kids concerns the early years of their passionate friendship, a time that coincided with the beginning of the end of Manhattan's last great bohemian age, when a couple with dreams of beatnik glory could live on day-old bread and cigarettes and paint fumes, all of which Smith evokes so precisely that one can smell the Nescafé boiling on a hot plate...More than a 1970s bohemian rhapsody, Just Kids is one of the best books ever written on becoming an artist— not the race for online celebrity and corporate sponsorship that often passes for artistic success these days, but the far more powerful, often difficult journey toward the ecstatic experience of capturing radiance of imagination on a page or stage or photographic paper. Jesus may have died for somebody's sins, but Patti Smith lives and writes and sings for all of us.""

—The Washington Post

""The reckless, splendid circus of New York's royal bohemia in the 1960s and '70s—rock idols, cowboy poets, Warhol Superstars—surrounds Smith in her heady recounting of a halcyon era. But the heart of Just Kids, a captivating memoir, is the lifelong love affair (first romantic, later creative and platonic) between Smith and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, before she became music's punk poet laureate and he one of the art world's most provocative and controversial figures. In her inimitable, lyrical style, Patti Smith recalls the pair's coming together as young, monumentally broke dreamers: ''just kids.'' What follows is both a poignant requiem (Mapplethorpe died of AIDS at age 43) and a radiant celebration of life.""

She grapples with an unshakable conviction that a vast chorus of voices now dictates her thoughts, posting her way deeper into the void as existential threats loom—climate change, economic precariousness, an unnamed dictator, an epidemic of loneliness.

An avalanche of images, details, and references accumulate to form a landscape that is post-sense, post-irony, post-everything. ""Are we in hell?"" the people of the portal ask themselves. ""Are we all just going to keep doing this until we die?""

Suddenly, two texts from her mother pierce the fray: ""Something has gone wrong,"" and ""How soon can you get here?"" As real life collides with the increasingly absurd antics of the portal, she confronts a world that seems to contain both abundant proof of goodness, empathy, and justice, and a deluge of evidence to the contrary.

The reasons for this desperate burst of violence—and the wild consequences that follow—lie at the heart of James McBride's funny, moving novel. McBride brings to vivid life everyone affected by the shooting: the victim, the African-American and Latinx residents who witnessed it, the white neighbors, local cops, members of the Five Ends Baptist Church where Sportcoat served as deacon, the neighborhood's Italian mobsters, and the enigmatic Sportcoat himself.

As the story deepens, the lives of these characters—caught in the tumultuous swirl of 1960s New York—overlap in unexpected ways.

The country falls under military control, with army chief Jorge Rafael Videla at the helm. With quiet U.S. support and tacit approval from Argentines exhausted by constant bombings and violence, the junta launches the National Reorganization Process—a bland name masking their ruthless campaign to crush the political left and instill ""Western, Christian"" values.

One of the military's most diabolical acts is kidnapping hundreds of pregnant women. After giving birth in captivity, the mothers are ""disappeared"" and their babies secretly given to other families—many headed by police or military officers. For the mothers and mothers-in-law of these women, the grief is twofold: the disappearance of their daughters and the theft of their grandchildren.

A group of fierce grandmothers forms the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, dedicated to finding the stolen infants and seeking justice from a nation that betrayed them. At a time when speaking out could mean death, the Abuelas confront military officers and launch protests to reach international diplomats. They become detectives, adopting disguises to observe suspected grandchildren, and work alongside a renowned American scientist to pioneer groundbreaking genetic tests.

The product of extensive archival research and meticulous reporting, this is narrative nonfiction that reads like a novel and reveals new truths about memory, identity, and family.","During Argentina's military dictatorship, hundreds of babies were stolen from disappeared mothers and given to other families.

Using a remarkable cache of little-studied documents, objects, and portraits only recently discovered, Jill Lepore brings Jane Franklin to vivid life. Like her famous brother, Jane was a passionate reader, gifted writer, and shrewd political commentator—but her brilliance was confined to the domestic sphere that defined women's lives in colonial America.

In An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond our own sensory confines, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. We encounter beetles drawn to fires, turtles that track Earth's magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and humans who wield sonar like bats.

We discover that a crocodile's scaly face is as sensitive as a lover's fingertips, that giant squid eyes evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street.

9781608198061,Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?,A Memoir,"In her first memoir, beloved New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the universal experience of caring for aging parents. Told through four-color cartoons, family photos, documents, and narrative that balances laughs with tears, this graphic memoir offers both comfort and comic relief for anyone navigating the life-altering challenge of elderly parent care.

For years, Roz relied on denial, avoidance, and distraction when it came to her mother and father. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to retrieve an old souvenir from the ""crazy closet""—with predictable results—those coping mechanisms could no longer work.

While the particulars are uniquely Chast-ian—an anxious father slipping into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had long sidelined Roz—the themes are achingly universal. Adult children accepting parental roles, aging parents leaving home for institutional care, managing uncomfortable physical intimacies, and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care.

An extraordinary portrait of two lives at their end and an only child doing her best to cope, this memoir showcases the full range of Chast's talent as both cartoonist and storyteller.","New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast chronicles her parents' final years in this groundbreaking graphic memoir.

Where did it all go wrong? Was it a patch of ice, a favor to a stranger, a bee trapped under a wedding veil? Can a single moment of bad luck derail an entire life?

9780593237144,There Is No Place for Us,Working and Homeless in America,"The working homeless. In a country where hard work and determination are supposed to lead to success, there's something scandalous about this phrase. But skyrocketing rents, low wages, and a lack of tenant rights have produced a startling phenomenon: People with full-time jobs cannot keep a roof over their heads, especially in America's booming cities, where rapid growth is leading to catastrophic displacement.

In this gripping and deeply reported book, Brian Goldstone plunges readers into the lives of five Atlanta families struggling to remain housed in a gentrifying, increasingly unequal city. Maurice and Natalia make a fresh start in the country's ""Black Mecca"" after being priced out of DC. Kara dreams of starting her own cleaning business while mopping floors at a public hospital. Britt scores a coveted housing voucher. Michelle is in school to become a social worker. Celeste toils at her warehouse job while undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer.

Through intimate, novelistic portraits, Goldstone reveals the human cost of this crisis, following parents and their kids as they sleep in cars or squalid extended-stay hotels, then head out to their jobs and schools the next morning. By turns heartbreaking and urgent, There Is No Place for Us illuminates the true magnitude of the new American homelessness—and shows that it won't be solved until housing is treated as a fundamental human right.",Five Atlanta families with full-time jobs face homelessness in America's booming cities.

9780593493762,I Heard Her Call My Name,A Memoir of Transition,"For a long time, Lucy Sante felt unsure of her place. Born in Belgium to conservative working-class Catholic parents, she found home only when she moved to New York City in the early 1970s and discovered her people among fellow bohemians. Some would die young from drugs and AIDS; others would become jarringly famous. Sante flirted with both fates while building an estimable career as a writer.

But she still felt like her life was a performance, presenting a facade even to herself.

Sante's memoir braids together two threads: the arc of her life and her recent transition to a place of inner and outer alignment. She brings loving irony to her unsteady first steps—there was much she needed to learn about being a woman after sixty years cloaked in a man's identity. A marvel of grace and empathy, I Heard Her Call My Name parses with great sensitivity the complexities of gender identity and the courage required to face who we really are.","An iconic writer's lapidary memoir of pursuing artistic truth while evading the truth of her own gender identity.

9781501166761,Asymmetry,,"Told in three distinct sections, Asymmetry explores the imbalances that define our most complex human relationships: inequities in age, power, talent, wealth, fame, geography, and justice.

The first section, ""Folly,"" follows Alice, a young American editor, and her relationship with the famous and much older writer Ezra Blazer. Set in New York during the early years of the Iraq War, it's both a tender account of unexpected romance and an aspiring novelist's coming-of-age.

""Madness"" shifts perspective entirely, narrated by Amar, an Iraqi-American man detained by immigration officers at Heathrow while traveling to visit his brother in Kurdistan. He spends the last weekend of 2008 in a holding room, reflecting on his life and circumstances.

She thinks she understands him too—he's sensitive like her, an artist, maybe even afraid of the dark. She's certain that one day they'll be reunited and she'll finally feel complete.

There are just a few problems: he's in prison, and she doesn't know what he did to end up there.

Through poverty, puberty, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley returns to her image of her father for hope and encouragement. She doesn't know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship turns sour, he assaults her.

Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley finally learns why her father is in prison. And that's where the story really begins.

Somebody's Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor Black girl, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she provides a poignant coming-of-age recollection about finding the threads between who you are and what you were born into.","Growing up poor and Black, Ashley clings to an idealized image of her incarcerated father—until devastating revelations force her to reckon with family, trauma, and survival.

The missing boy cleaves the family with doubt. Their father leaves, starts another family elsewhere. But their mother can't give up hope and launches an organization dedicated to missing children.

As C grows older, she sees her brother everywhere: in bistros, airplane aisles, subway cars. Here is her brother's older face, the light in his eyes, the way he seems to recognize her, too. But it can't be, of course. Or can it?

Then one day, in another accident, C meets a man both mysterious and familiar—a man who is also searching for someone and for his own place in the world. His name is Wayne.

It's a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that's become sacred to her.

Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement from those closest to her—and from herself.

Decades later, Ashley's granddaughter Ruth would embroider their family's story onto that same sack in spare, haunting words that preserved what official records never could. Historian Tiya Miles carefully traces these women's faint presence in archives, but when documentation fails, she turns to objects, art, and landscape to reconstruct their lives.

9781455502776,Arguably,Essays by Christopher Hitchens,"Christopher Hitchens invites readers into a democratic conversation marked by formidable knowledge, encyclopedic recall, and fearless intellectual honesty. Reading him feels like hearing someone think out loud, following logic wherever it leads—unafraid to expose fraud, denounce injustice, or excoriate hypocrisy.

His felicity with language is legendary, every sentence crackling with oxygen and wit. Legions of readers, admirers and detractors alike, approach his work with something approaching awe at his readiness to fight intellectual battles and mount the ramparts for reason.

This collection offers fresh perceptions of figures as varied as Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, Rebecca West, George Orwell, J.G. Ballard, and Philip Larkin, matched by pungent discussions drawn from a lifetime of traveling and reporting from Iran, China, and Pakistan.

Hitchens's directness, elegance, and lightly carried erudition set a standard for the essayist rarely matched in our time. What emerges is an intellectual self-portrait of a writer with exemplary steadiness of purpose and a profound love affair with the English language—a man anchored in a humane vision of humanity's longing for reason and justice.","Hitchens at his most essential: four decades of pitch-perfect prose defending the principles of reason, tolerance, and skepticism that define civilization.

He died in December 2011.","""Bright, witty… one of the most lucid and humane voices of our age.""

—The Globe and Mail

""Anyone who occasionally opens one of our more serious periodicals has learned that the byline of Christopher Hitchens is an opportunity to be delighted or maddened-possibly both-but in any case not to be missed....His range is extraordinary, both in breadth and altitude. He is as self-confident on the politics of Lebanon as on the ontology of the Harry Potter books....I still find Hitchens one of the most stimulating thinkers and entertaining we have, even when-perhaps especially when-he provokes.""

—Bill Keller, The New York Times

""One reads him [Hitchens] despite his reputation as someone who wants to drink, argue, and tear the ornaments off the tree, because he is, first and last, a writer, an always exciting, often exacting, furious polemicist. This fact, the most salient thing about him, often gets neglected in the public jousting. Arguably, Hitchens's new collection, forcefully proves this point. Consisting of three kinds of writing - literary journalism, political commentary, and cultural complaint - Arguably offers a panoramic if somewhat jaundiced view of the last decade or so of cultural and political history.""

9780735212176,Exit West,,"In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive love affair, cloistered in premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city.

When violence explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—magical portals that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and old lives behind, they find a door and step through.

Exit West follows these remarkable characters as they emerge into an alien and uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that speaks to our current moment while remaining timelessly human.",Two young lovers flee their war-torn homeland through magical doors that transport refugees across the globe.

He divides his time between Lahore, New York, and London.","""In spare, crystalline prose, Hamid conveys the experience of living in a city under siege with sharp, stabbing immediacy. He shows just how swiftly ordinary life — with all its banal rituals and routines — can morph into the defensive crouch of life in a war zone. … [and] how insidiously violence alters the calculus of daily life. … By mixing the real and the surreal, and using old fairy-tale magic, Hamid has created a fictional universe that captures the global perils percolating beneath today's headlines.""

—Michiko Kakutani, New York Times

""No novel is really about the cliche called 'the human condition,' but good novels expose and interpret the particular condition of the humans in their charge, and this is what Hamid has achieved here. If in its physical and perilous immediacy Nadia and Saeed's condition is alien to the mass of us, Exit West makes a final, certain declaration of affinity: 'We are all migrants through time.'""

9780385350662,The Invention of Nature,Alexander von Humboldt's New World,"Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the world's highest volcanoes, racing through anthrax-infected Siberia, or translating his research into bestselling publications that transformed science and thinking.

Among Humboldt's most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature as a complex, interconnected global force that doesn't exist for humankind's use alone. Andrea Wulf brings this remarkable figure back into focus, chronicling his daring expeditions and investigations of wild environments worldwide, his discoveries of similarities between climate zones on different continents, and his prescient prediction of human-induced climate change.

Wulf explores how Humboldt's writings inspired naturalists and poets like Darwin, Wordsworth, and Goethe, making a compelling case that his influence led John Muir to natural preservation and shaped Thoreau's Walden. Through brilliant research and compelling prose, Wulf reveals how Humboldt created our modern understanding of the natural world and champions renewed interest in this vital figure in environmental history.","The forgotten story of Alexander von Humboldt, the visionary German naturalist whose revolutionary ideas about interconnected nature created modern environmentalism and inspired Darwin, Thoreau, and countless others.",496,,Nature / Environmental Conservation & Protection,Knopf,15/09/2015,Andrea Wulf,"Andrea Wulf was born in India and moved to Germany as a child.

""Wulf (Chasing Venus) makes an impassioned case for the reinstatement of the boundlessly energetic, perpetually curious, prolific polymath von Humboldt (1769–1859) as a key figure in the history of science. . . .

Their name adorns Harvard, the Met, Oxford, and the Louvre. They're one of the world's richest families, but the source of their fortune remained deliberately vague until a devastating truth emerged: the Sacklers built their empire on the painkiller that sparked America's opioid crisis.

Empire of Pain traces three generations of this singular family, moving from early twentieth-century Brooklyn to Greenwich mansions and Cap d'Antibes estates to Washington's corridors of power. It follows their early success with Valium to the far more potent OxyContin, marketed through ruthless tactics—co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, systematically downplaying addiction risks.

Keefe chronicles the multiple investigations into the Sacklers and their company, revealing the scorched-earth legal strategies they deployed to evade accountability. This masterpiece of narrative reporting delivers a ferociously compelling portrait of America's second Gilded Age—a study of elite impunity and an unflinching investigation of the naked greed behind one of the world's great fortunes.",Three generations of the Sackler family built a fortune on Valium and OxyContin while their name graced museum walls worldwide.

With the grit of Raymond Carver, the humor of Grace Paley, and a blend of wit and melancholy all her own, Berlin crafts miracles from the everyday.

She uncovers moments of grace in the Laundromats and halfway houses of the American Southwest, in the homes of the Bay Area upper class, among switchboard operators and struggling mothers, hitchhikers and bad Christians. Her stories are inspired by a life lived fully—from her childhood in Western mining towns to glamorous teenage years in Santiago, Chile, through three failed marriages, battles with alcoholism, and the various jobs she held to support her writing and four sons.

As she began to write about the experience of living through all the dying, she realized the devastating truth. Her brother and friends all died because of who they were and where they were from—because they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle that fostered drug addiction and the dissolution of family and relationships.

Ward grew up in poverty in rural Mississippi. She writes powerfully about the pressures this brings, on the men who can do no right and the women who stand in for family in a society where the men are often absent.

Ken, whose Japanese American family has been in the United States for generations, is mainstream; for Hua, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who makes 'zines and haunts Bay Area record shops, Ken represents all that he defines himself in opposition to. The only thing they have in common is that American culture doesn't seem to have a place for either of them.

But despite his first impressions, Hua and Ken become friends—a friendship built on late-night conversations over cigarettes, long drives along the California coast, and the successes and humiliations of everyday college life. And then violently, senselessly, Ken is gone, killed in a carjacking not even three years after they first meet.

""Stay True feels like one of those books that is the sum total of a writer's life in thinking, craft, and curiosity, made felt at last, so that when the sentences come, they come with a deliberate, patient, and precise force. Hsu takes on the central theme of a friend's violent loss and casts from that void a story that, somehow, despite the hurt and confusion, embraces the world around it with a steady and capacious centrifugal force.

Scientists worldwide are now monitoring the sixth extinction—predicted to be the most devastating since the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time, the cataclysm is us.

Two-time National Magazine Award winner and New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on research across multiple disciplines, accompanying scientists into the field: geologists studying deep ocean cores, botanists following tree lines climbing the Andes, marine biologists diving the Great Barrier Reef.

She introduces us to a dozen species—some already gone, others facing extinction—including the Panamanian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of disappearances occurring around us and traces extinction as a concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris to today.

Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties.

Cleopatra appears to have had relationships with only two men—but they happened to be Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. She had a child with Caesar and three more with Antony after Caesar's murder. Already the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean, her alliance with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age.

Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare, Shaw, Michelangelo, and Elizabeth Taylor have all shaped her legend. In this masterly return to classical sources, Stacy Schiff boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order.","Stacy Schiff strips away centuries of myth to reveal the real Cleopatra—brilliant strategist, master negotiator, and the most powerful woman in the ancient world.

Ailey Pearl Garfield has understood these words since childhood. Named for choreographer Alvin Ailey and her enslaved great-grandmother, she carries the weight of this Problem on her shoulders.

Raised by an accomplished doctor and strict schoolteacher, Ailey splits her time between the City and summers in Chicasetta, Georgia, where her mother's family has lived since their ancestors arrived in bondage. She struggles with this duality—caught between her exacting parents and imperious, light-skinned grandmother Nana Claire, who values skin color above all, and the pull of the ""deep country"" where her mother's family endured slavery and Jim Crow.

How can Ailey meet everyone's expectations when half her family rejects their fraught racial history while the rest can't break free from it? To understand who she is, Ailey embarks on a journey through her family's past, uncovering shocking tales of generations of ancestors—Black, Indigenous, and white—in the deep South.

Pabst believes he can resist these advances, that he will submit to no dictatorship other than art. But he has already taken the first steps into a hopeless entanglement.

Who was the mysterious man she had gone to meet? What exactly did Lucie do at her hostess job in the notorious Roppongi nightclub district? How many others had suffered the same fate?

Richard Lloyd Parry, an award-winning foreign correspondent, covered Lucie's case from the beginning.

A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver's enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84—""Q is for 'question mark.' A world that bears a question.""

Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that his previously placid life begins to unravel.

As their narratives converge over this single year, we learn of the profound connections that bind them: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult; a reclusive dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.

A love story, mystery, and fantasy rolled into one, 1Q84 is Murakami's most ambitious undertaking—a tremendous feat of imagination that rivals Orwell's dystopian vision while remaining uniquely, unmistakably his own.","In 1984 Tokyo, a woman discovers she's slipped into a parallel world while a writer becomes entangled with a mysterious cult.

Murakami's fans know that his focus has always been on the quiet strangeness of life, the hidden connections between perfect strangers, and the power of the non sequitur to reveal the associative strands that weave our modern world. 1Q84 goes further than any Murakami novel so far, and perhaps further than any novel before it, toward exposing the delicacy of the membranes that separate love from chance encounters, the kind from the wicked, and reality from what people living in the pent-up modern world dream about when they go to sleep under an alien moon.""

Two-and-a-half years later, he was killed on a Hawaiian beach in a conflict with native islanders. How did Cook—uniquely respected among captains for his treatment of Indigenous peoples—come to that fatal moment?

Hampton Sides delivers a bravura account of Cook's final journey, wrestling with his complex legacy while providing a thrilling narrative of 18th-century exploration's dangers and discoveries. Cook was renowned for his seamanship, humane leadership, and scientific dedication. On previous expeditions, he mapped vast Pacific territories, including Australia's east coast, and initiated first European contact with numerous peoples. He treated his crew well and approached new societies with curiosity rather than judgment.

Yet something changed on this last voyage. Cook became mercurial, resorting to violent discipline and leading his vessels into repeated danger. He ordered brutal retaliation against native peoples for perceived theft. His secret orders—to chart and claim lands before Britain's rivals and discover the Northwest Passage—may explain this transformation. Whatever his intentions, Cook's scientific mission served colonial conquest, with catastrophic effects for Indigenous populations worldwide.

These tensions culminated in Hawaii, where his initially harmonious landing soured into fatal confrontation upon his return from mapping the Pacific Northwest.",Hampton Sides chronicles Captain Cook's final voyage—from celebrated explorer to his death on a Hawaiian beach in 1779.

He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, and multiple severe disabilities, as well as children who are prodigies, conceived in rape, become criminals, or are transgender.

While each of these characteristics is potentially isolating, the experience of difference within families is universal, and Solomon documents triumphs of love over prejudice in every chapter. All parenting turns on a crucial question: to what extent should parents accept their children for who they are, and to what extent should they help them become their best selves?

Drawing on ten years of research and interviews with more than three hundred families, Solomon mines the eloquence of ordinary people facing extreme challenges. Elegantly reported by a spectacularly original and compassionate thinker, Far from the Tree explores how people who love each other must struggle to accept each other—a theme in every family's life.","Through interviews with hundreds of families, Solomon examines how parents navigate raising children with profound differences.

Constantly rewriting his own story, he became a criminal, a minister, a leader, and an icon, all before being felled by assassins' bullets at age thirty-nine. Through tireless work and countless speeches, he empowered hundreds of thousands of black Americans to create better lives and stronger communities while establishing the template for the self-actualized, independent African American man.

Manning Marable's biography is a stunning achievement filled with new information and shocking revelations that go beyond the Autobiography. Malcolm X unfolds a sweeping story of race and class in America, from the rise of Marcus Garvey and the Ku Klux Klan to the struggles of the civil rights movement in the fifties and sixties.

Reaching into Malcolm's troubled youth, it traces a path from his parents' activism through his engagement with the Nation of Islam, charting his astronomical rise in Black Nationalism and culminating in the never-before-told true story of his assassination.

Now, on this chilly Thanksgiving, the Bravos are guests of the Dallas Cowboys, slated for the Halftime Show alongside Destiny's Child. Among them is Silver Star-winning Specialist William Lynn, a nineteen-year-old Texas native and hero of Al-Ansakar.

Amid clamoring patriots with flag pins and ""support our troops"" bumper stickers, the Bravos encounter the Cowboys' hard-nosed owner and his wealthy colleagues, a born-again cheerleader, a veteran Hollywood producer, and supersized players eager for vicarious battle stories. Between these faces Billy sees his worried sisters, broken father, and Shroom—the philosophical sergeant who died in his arms.

Over this single day, Billy will discover difficult truths about himself, his country, his struggling family, and his brothers in arms. In his final hours before returning to Iraq, he'll drink and brawl, yearn for home, face a heart-wrenching decision, and discover both pure love and bitter wisdom far beyond his years.","Iraq War soldiers become unlikely celebrities at a Dallas Cowboys game, exposing the chasm between battlefield reality and American spectacle.

9780374602390,The Copenhagen Trilogy,Childhood; Youth; Dependency,"Tove Ditlevsen is celebrated as one of the most important voices in twentieth-century Danish literature, and the Copenhagen Trilogy is her rediscovered masterpiece.

Childhood follows a misfit girl's fierce determination to become a poet. Youth captures her early encounters with sex, work, and independence. In Dependency, she enters the first of four marriages and spirals into drug addiction, enabled by her manipulative doctor-husband.

Throughout, Ditlevsen navigates the impossible tension between her calling as a writer and her roles as daughter, wife, mother, and addict. Dismissed by critics during her lifetime, the trilogy is now hailed as a literary triumph and spiritual ancestor of today's autofiction.

Remarkable for its unflinching intensity, the work offers an immersive exploration of female friendship, family dynamics, and a young woman's struggle to be taken seriously as an artist—all while chronicling the devastating descent into addiction.","Ditlevsen chronicles her journey from working-class girlhood to literary ambition to devastating addiction.

His daughter is an irreverent poet who long ago left the Church's country. When an unexpected crisis leads her and her husband to move back into her parents' rectory, their two worlds collide.

In Priestdaddy, Lockwood interweaves emblematic moments from her childhood and adolescence—from an ill-fated family hunting trip and an abortion clinic sit-in where her father was arrested to her involvement in a cultlike Catholic youth group—with scenes that chronicle the eight-month adventure she and her husband had living in her parents' household after a decade on their own.

Lockwood details her education of a seminarian also living at the rectory, tries to explain Catholicism to her mystified husband, and encounters mysterious substances on hotel beds with her mother. She pivots from the raunchy to the sublime, from the comic to the deeply serious, exploring issues of belief, belonging, and personhood.

Thrust into an open society miles away from the world he knew, Khaled begins to transform. When he attends a protest against the Qaddafi regime in London, it explodes into tragedy. In a flash, he finds himself injured, clinging to life, unable to leave Britain or return home. Even telling his parents what he has done would expose them to danger on tapped phone lines.

A chance hotel encounter brings Khaled face-to-face with Hosam Zowa himself, leading to the deepest friendship of his life.

The Gene brings to life our quest to understand how genetics influences our lives, personalities, identities, and fates.

Mukherjee weaves together centuries of research and experimentation—from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from early geneticists to the revolutionary innovators who mapped the human genome. Throughout, he grounds abstract scientific concepts in deeply personal stories, including his own family's tragic history with mental illness, reminding us of the complex questions surrounding our ability to translate genetic science into real-world applications.

Written with scientific rigor wrapped in lyrical prose, this revelatory work captures both the wonder of genetic discovery and the sobering implications of our growing power to manipulate the very code of life.","From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author comes a sweeping exploration of genetics that weaves together scientific discovery, family memoir, and the ethical questions surrounding our genetic future.",608,,Medical / History,Scribner,17/05/2016,Siddhartha Mukherjee,"Siddhartha Mukherjee is the author of The Song of the Cell, The Gene: An Intimate History (#1 New York Times bestseller), The Emperor of All Maladies (2011 Pulitzer Prize winner), and The Laws of Medicine.

At its center is a romance: Nelson's relationship with artist Harry Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, and her journey through pregnancy—an intimate portrayal of the complexities and joys of queer family-making.

Writing in the spirit of public intellectuals like Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds personal experience to rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Her insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising work of autotheory.","Nelson weaves personal narrative with critical theory to explore queer love, family-making, and identity.

Instead, he went home to his great-grandfather's estate, a house he had begun rebuilding three years earlier.

House of Stone chronicles both a battle-scarred home and a war correspondent's jostled spirit, revealing how reconstructing one came to fortify the other.

René suffers extraordinary hardship in the oppressive forest he's charged with clearing. Forced to marry a Mi'kmaw woman, his descendants live trapped between two conflicting cultures. Duquet, crafty and ruthless, escapes his indenture to become a fur trader and eventually builds a timber empire.

Proulx follows both family lines across three centuries as they travel throughout North America, Europe, China, and New Zealand under brutal conditions—facing rival attacks, accidents, disease, and cultural destruction. Generation after generation seizes what they can from seemingly infinite forests, leaving modern descendants to confront potential ecological collapse.

Proulx creates characters so vivid in their greed, vengefulness, and hope that we follow them with fierce attention. This magnificent marriage of history and imagination stands as her most formidable work—an epic that traces how humanity's insatiable appetite shaped both families and the natural world.","Two French indentured servants in 17th-century New France take vastly different paths—one trapped between cultures, the other building a timber empire.

The entire world watched the grueling rescue unfold above ground, but the saga of what happened below the Earth's surface has never been told—until now.

For Deep Down Dark, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Héctor Tobar received exclusive access to the miners and their stories. These thirty-three men came to think of the mine—a cavern inflicting constant, thundering aural torment—as both coffin and church, a place where they sought redemption through prayer while confronting their mortality.

Udall creates characters that engage us fully as they grapple with the nature of need, love, and belonging.

9781524732851,Fire Weather,A True Story from a Hotter World,"In May 2016, Fort McMurray—the hub of Canada's oil industry and America's biggest foreign supplier—was overrun by wildfire. The multi-billion-dollar disaster melted vehicles, turned entire neighborhoods into firebombs, and drove 88,000 people from their homes in a single afternoon.

Through the lens of this apocalyptic conflagration, John Vaillant warns that this was not a unique event, but a shocking preview of what we must prepare for in a hotter, more flammable world. Fire has been our partner for hundreds of millennia, shaping culture, civilization, and very likely our brains. It has enabled us to cook our food, defend our homes, and power the machines that drive our economy. Yet this volatile energy source has always threatened to elude our control.

With masterly prose and a cinematic eye, Vaillant takes us on a riveting journey through the intertwined histories of North America's oil industry and the birth of climate science, to the unprecedented devastation wrought by modern forest fires, and into lives forever changed by these disasters. This is urgent work from our new century of fire, which has only just begun.","The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire becomes a lens for understanding our changing relationship with fire itself.

When he was eight, his family fled for political reasons. Eight years later, his father—a former diplomat turned dissident—was kidnapped from Cairo's streets by the Libyan government and imprisoned in the regime's most notorious jail.

Now the prisons stand empty, and little hope remains that Jaballah Matar will be found alive. Yet hope, as Matar writes, is ""persistent and cunning."" What emerges is both a deeply personal search and a meditation on loss, exile, and the enduring bonds between fathers and sons.

9781451648539,Steve Jobs,,"Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs and conversations with over 100 family members, friends, competitors, and colleagues, Walter Isaacson delivers a riveting portrait of the creative entrepreneur who revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.

Jobs emerges as the ultimate icon of applied imagination—someone who understood that twenty-first-century value comes from connecting creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of imagination merged with remarkable engineering feats.

Though Jobs cooperated fully with Isaacson, he demanded no editorial control and put nothing off-limits. He encouraged brutal honesty from everyone involved. The result is an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, and compulsive need for control that shaped both his business approach and the innovative products that followed.

This tale is both instructive and cautionary, offering essential lessons about innovation, leadership, character, and values from one of history's most complex and influential figures.","The definitive biography of Apple's mercurial cofounder, built from unprecedented access to Jobs himself and those closest to him.

But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults—it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities.

Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined.

Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, exploring the multiple reasons people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins.","Twin sisters choose radically different paths when one decides to pass for white while the other remains in their black community.

As she chases obsessive love, damage, and transcendence in Dublin and beyond, her grandfather's poetry seems to guide her home.

Nell's mother, Carmel, knows the magic of her father's poetry too well—the kind that makes women slip outside for a kiss and then elope, as her own mother Terry had done. In his poems, Phil envisions Carmel as a bright-eyed wren escaping from his hand. But it is Phil who departs, abandoning his wife and two young daughters.

Thirty-seven days later, it was at war—a conflict that would kill over fifteen million people, destroy three empires, and permanently alter world history.

The Sleepwalkers reveals in gripping detail how this crisis unfolded. Drawing on fresh sources, Clark traces the paths to war in a minute-by-minute narrative that cuts between key decision centers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, London, and Belgrade. He examines the decades of history that informed the events of 1914 and details the mutual misunderstandings and unintended signals that drove the crisis forward.

How did the Balkans—a peripheral region far from Europe's centers of power—come to be the center of such magnitude? Clark reveals a Europe racked by chronic problems, a fractured world of instability saddled with conspicuously ineffectual political leaders. These rulers, who prided themselves on modernity and rationalism, stumbled through crisis after crisis and finally convinced themselves that war was the only answer.

In this devastating memoir, Deraniyagala chronicles both the horror of that morning and the impossible journey that followed. She writes with unflinching honesty about the early months of grief, when she fought furiously against a reality too brutal to accept. Then, slowly and reluctantly, she begins to let memory carry her back through the rich life she's mourning—from her family's London home to her children's births, from meeting her English husband at Cambridge to her childhood in Colombo.

The project began with a grievance—the grievance of a daughter whose parent had absconded from her life. She was pursuing a scofflaw who had skipped out on obligation, affection, and contrition. She was preparing an indictment. But somewhere along the line, the prosecutor became a witness.

When the feminist writer learned that her 76-year-old father—long estranged and living in Hungary—had undergone sex reassignment surgery, her investigation turned personal and urgent. How was this new parent who claimed to be ""a complete woman now"" connected to the silent, explosive father she had known?

Faludi chases that mystery through her father's many incarnations: American dad, Alpine mountaineer, swashbuckling adventurer, Jewish fugitive in Holocaust Budapest. When she travels to Hungary for their reunion, she drops into a labyrinth of dark histories and dangerous politics in a country hell-bent on repressing its past.

Raised by a single father—a controversial sociologist—he spent his childhood as a subject in racially charged psychological studies, promised that his father's work would become a lucrative memoir.

But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he discovers there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.

Enlisting help from the town's most famous resident—Hominy Jenkins, the last surviving Little Rascal—he reinstates slavery and segregates the local high school, landing himself before the Supreme Court.

John von Neumann was a prodigy whose gifts terrified those around him. He transformed every field he touched—inventing game theory and the first programmable computer, pioneering AI, digital life, and cellular automata. Through a chorus of family members, friends, colleagues, and rivals, Labatut traces the evolution of an unmatched mind and a body of work that has fundamentally unmoored our world.

The MANIAC places von Neumann at the center of a literary triptych. It begins with Paul Ehrenfest, an Austrian physicist and friend of Einstein who fell into despair watching science become a tyrannical force. It ends a century later with the showdown between Go master Lee Sedol and the AI program AlphaGo—an encounter embodying the central question of von Neumann's most ambitious unfinished project: creating a self-reproducing machine, an intelligence able to evolve beyond human understanding or control.

Drawing from her own experiences of illness and injury, Jamison ventures far beyond personal narrative. She explores poverty tourism and phantom diseases, street violence and reality television, illness and incarceration—all in service of understanding empathy's complexities. Is empathy a tool for genuine connection, or has it become a way to test and grade each other?

He explores his struggles with anorexia, obesity, gambling, and the weight of secrets he and his mother spent years avoiding. This isn't just personal confession—it's an urgent examination of how few people in America actually know how to love responsibly or live with the weight of true freedom.

Kennedy's seemingly limitless ambition drove his career to extraordinary heights—banker, World War I shipyard manager, Hollywood studio head, Wall Street operator, New Deal presidential adviser, and founding chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His astounding fall from grace came during the years surrounding America's entry into World War II, when his antiwar stance as the first Irish American ambassador to London earned him White House ire and popular contempt.

This is also the story of the family Kennedy raised and the children who completed the journey he began. Of his many roles, father was most dear to him, though tragedies would mark his final years with unspeakable suffering.

Drawing on never-before-published materials from archives on three continents, Nasaw answers the haunting questions about Kennedy's life and legacy. In studying Kennedy's story, we relive the history of the American Century itself.","The definitive biography of Joseph P. Kennedy, based on exclusive access to his private papers.

One wonders what was going through the mind of the patriarch, sitting a few feet away listening to that soaring sentiment as a fourth-generation Kennedy became president of the United States. After coming to know him over the course of this brilliant, compelling book, the reader might suspect that he was thinking he had done more than enough for his country. But the gods would demand even more.""

""[A] sprawling, highly readable biography of the dynast and larger-than-life figure whose presence still haunts American political life... Working from his subject's extensive archives, Nasaw (Andrew Carnegie, 2006, etc.) pieces together a sometimes-sympathetic, sometimes-critical view of Joseph P. Kennedy (1888–1969), father of John F.

In the cafés on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot at the heart of the greatest English novels.

As Madeleine questions why it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike in favor of the Marquis de Sade, real life intervenes in the form of two very different guys. Leonard Bankhead—charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy—suddenly appears in a semiotics seminar, drawing Madeleine into a charged erotic and intellectual relationship. Meanwhile, her old friend Mitchell Grammaticus resurfaces, obsessed with Christian mysticism and convinced that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.

Over the next year, as the triangle graduates and enters the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology lab on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret behind Leonard's inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. Mitchell travels the world trying to forget Madeleine, only to confront ultimate questions about life, God, and love.

Spring, 1849. Eli McCullough is thirteen when Comanche raiders storm his homestead, brutally murdering his mother and sister and taking him captive. The first male child born in the newly established Republic of Texas, Eli quickly adapts to Comanche life, learning their language, earning a place as the chief's adopted son, and waging war against their enemies—including white men. When disease and overwhelming numbers of armed Americans decimate the tribe, Eli finds himself alone. Neither white nor Indian, he must carve a place in a world where he doesn't fully belong.

Intertwined with Eli's story are those of his son Peter, who bears the emotional cost of his father's ruthless ambition, and JA, Eli's great-granddaughter, who must fight hardened rivals to succeed in a man's world. Meyer deftly explores how Eli's steely pragmatism transforms subsequent generations as the McCulloughs become one of Texas's most powerful ranching-and-oil dynasties.

Though the shooter targeted Mother Emanuel—the first AME church in the South—hoping to ignite racial strife, he couldn't have anticipated what followed: an outpouring of forgiveness from victims' families and a profound reckoning with Charleston's deep racial divisions.

In Mother Emanuel, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Kevin Sack explores the inspiring history that brought the church to that tragic moment and the depth of desecration committed in its fellowship hall. He reveals how African Methodism grew from the harshest American soil, and how Black suffering shaped forgiveness into both religious practice and survival tool.

Sack uses the church's story to trace the long arc of Black life in Charleston, where nearly half of enslaved Africans disembarked and the Civil War began. Through one congregation's journey—from its daring 1817 breakaway from white churches, through Civil War and Reconstruction traumas, to its pivotal Civil Rights role—he explores the development of a unique Christian practice.

She's inspired countless musicians—from James Taylor to Prince to Brandi Carlile—yet she remains tantalizingly elusive, beckoning us closer while simultaneously pushing us away. Music critic Ann Powers wondered if there was another way to understand this singular artist who never stops moving, never stops experimenting.

In Traveling, Powers seeks to understand Mitchell through her myriad journeys.

She charts the course of Mitchell's musical evolution from early folk to jazz fusion to pop experimentation, following her collaborations with other greats and the loves that emerged along the way—all through to Mitchell's remarkable return to music-making after the 2015 aneurysm that nearly took her life.

He believed womanhood would make them morally weak and impure, that a woman's highest virtue was obedience.

To keep Babylon at bay, he forbade almost everything. The women wore only long skirts and dresses, head wraps to cover their hair, no makeup, no jewelry. No opinions, no friends. Safiya's mother, while loyal to her husband, secretly gave her children the gift of books and poetry, which became Safiya's lifeline.

Chicken Hill was home to Moshe and Chona Ludlow—he ran an integrated theater, she operated the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store. When the state threatened to institutionalize a deaf boy, Chona partnered with Nate Timblin, the Black janitor at Moshe's theater and unofficial leader of the neighborhood's Black community, to keep the child safe.

As these interconnected stories unfold, McBride reveals how people living on the margins of white, Christian America fight to survive and protect each other.

It's the story of Monticello Plantation, where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It's the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It's the story of Angola, a former plantation turned maximum-security prison in Louisiana, filled with Black men who work across 18,000 acres for virtually no pay. And it's the story of Blandford Cemetery, final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers.

This deeply researched exploration reveals how some of our country's most essential stories hide in plain view—in places we drive by on our way to work, holidays like Juneteenth, or neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the slave trade has been deeply imprinted.

The only person ever to win Oscar, Emmy, and Tony awards in the same year, Fosse revolutionized nearly every facet of American entertainment, forever marking Broadway and Hollywood with his iconic style—hat tilted, fingers splayed—that would influence generations of performing artists.

Yet despite Fosse's innumerable achievements, no accomplishment ever seemed to satisfy him, and offstage his life was shadowed in turmoil and anxiety. Bestselling author Sam Wasson unveils the man behind the swaggering sex appeal, tracing Fosse's untold reinventions over a career that spawned The Pajama Game, Cabaret, Pippin, All That Jazz, and Chicago, one of the longest-running Broadway musicals ever.

Drawing on unpublished material and hundreds of sources—friends, enemies, lovers, and collaborators, many speaking publicly about Fosse for the first time—Wasson illuminates both Fosse's prodigious professional life and his close, conflicted relationships with everyone from Liza Minnelli to Ann Reinking to Jessica Lange and Dustin Hoffman.

Edgar Hoover as a bulldog—squat frame, bulging eyes, fearsome jowls—but in 1924, when he became FBI director, he was the trim, dazzling wunderkind of the administrative state. He transformed a scandal-riddled law enforcement backwater into a modern machine, believing in the federal government's power to do great things for the nation.

He also believed that certain people—many of them communists or racial minorities—didn't deserve to be included in that American project. Hoover rose to power and stayed there for decades, using state tools to create a personal fiefdom unrivaled in U.S. history.

Beverly Gage's monumental biography explores the full sweep of Hoover's life, from his 1895 birth to a modest Washington family through his 1972 death. Her nuanced portrait reveals how Hoover was more than a one-dimensional tyrant. As FBI director for 48 years, he was confidant, counselor, and adversary to eight presidents.

Instead, it was a period of rising anger and domestic turmoil that anticipated the polarization and extremism we know today.

In When the Clock Broke, acclaimed political writer John Ganz tells the story of America's late-century discontents. From upheavals in Crown Heights and Los Angeles to the advent of David Duke and heartland survivalists, from Rush Limbaugh's broadcasts to bitter disputes between neoconservatives and the ""paleo-con"" right, Ganz immerses us in a time when what Philip Roth called the ""indigenous American berserk"" took new and wilder forms.

During the 1992 campaign, Pat Buchanan's and Ross Perot's insurgent populist bids upended the political establishment while Americans struggled through recession, alarm about racial and social change, the specter of a new power in Asia, and the end of Cold War–era political norms. Conspiracy theories surged as intellectuals and activists strove to understand the ""Middle American Radicals"" whose alienation fueled new causes.

We follow him from Key West to Paris, to New York, Africa, Cuba, and finally Idaho, as he wrestles with his best angels and worst demons. Whenever he could, he returned to his beloved fishing cruiser to exult in the sea, fight the biggest fish he could find, drink, entertain celebrities and seduce women, and be with his children. But as he began to succumb to the diseases of fame, Pilar was also where he cursed his critics, saw marriages and friendships dissolve, and tried in vain to escape his increasingly diminished capacities.

Generally thought of as a great writer and an unappealing human being, Hemingway emerges here in a far more benevolent light. Drawing on previously unpublished material, including interviews with Hemingway's sons, Hendrickson shows that for all the writer's boorishness, depression, and alcoholism, he was capable of remarkable generosity—to struggling writers, to lost souls, to the dying son of a friend.

Most poignantly, we see his relationship with his youngest son, Gigi, who lived his adult life mostly as a cross-dresser and died alone in a Miami women's jail. Hendrickson's bold and beautiful book makes the case that both men were braver than we know, struggling against the complicated emotions swirling around them.","Using Hemingway's beloved boat Pilar as an anchor point, Hendrickson traces the writer's final decades with remarkable nuance.

9780393609844,Unworthy Republic,The Dispossession of Native Americans and the Road to Indian Territory,"In May 1830, the United States formally launched a policy to expel Native Americans from the East to territories west of the Mississippi River. Justified as a humanitarian enterprise, the undertaking was to be systematic and rational, overseen by Washington's small but growing bureaucracy.

But as the policy unfolded over the next decade, thousands of Native Americans died under the federal government's auspices, and thousands of others lost their possessions and homelands in an orgy of fraud, intimidation, and violence. Drawing on firsthand accounts and voluminous federal records, Saunt reveals how this deportation of 80,000 men, women, and children became national policy.

This deeply researched book argues that Indian Removal was not an inevitable chapter in U.S. expansion. Rather, it was a fiercely contested political act designed to secure new lands for slavery's expansion and consolidate southern power. Indigenous peoples fought relentlessly against the policy, while many U.S. citizens insisted it betrayed the nation's values. When Congress passed the act by a razor-thin margin, it authorized one of the first state-sponsored mass deportations in the modern era.

9781594486005,A Brief History of Seven Killings,,"On December 3, 1976, seven gunmen stormed Bob Marley's house in Kingston, Jamaica, machine guns blazing. The attack came just before the general election and two days before Marley's planned Smile Jamaica Concert—a show meant to ease political tensions. The singer, his wife, and manager were wounded, but little was officially released about the gunmen's identities or motives.

Marlon James transforms this real event into an epic exploration of Jamaica's turbulent history. Through the voices of gunmen, drug dealers, CIA agents, and even ghosts, he chronicles thirty years of violence and consequence. The story moves from the dangerous streets of 1970s Kingston to the crack houses of 1980s New York, finally returning to a radically altered Jamaica of the 1990s.

James creates an unforgettable cast of characters whose fates intertwine across decades. As they navigate a world where politics and crime blur together, they discover that evil casts long shadows and no one can truly escape their past. Gripping and inventive, this is a mesmerizing novel of power, violence, and the stories we tell ourselves to survive.","Seven gunmen storm Bob Marley's house in 1976 Kingston, launching an epic chronicle of violence, politics, and consequence across three decades.

9780374277895,One of Us,The Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway,"On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik detonated a bomb outside government buildings in central Oslo, killing eight people. He then proceeded to a youth camp on the island of Utøya, where he killed sixty-nine more—most of them teenage members of Norway's governing Labour Party.

In One of Us, journalist Åsne Seierstad tells the story of this terrible day and what led up to it. What made Breivik, a gifted child from an affluent Oslo neighborhood, become a terrorist?

Seierstad delves deep into Breivik's troubled childhood, showing how a hip-hop and graffiti aficionado became a right-wing activist and Internet game addict, then an entrepreneur, Freemason, and self-styled master warrior who sought to ""save Norway"" from Islam and multiculturalism. She writes with equal intimacy about Breivik's victims, tracing their political awakenings, aspirations to improve their country, and ill-fated journeys to the island.

By the time Seierstad reaches Utøya, we know both the killer and those he will kill. We have also gotten to know an entire country—famously peaceful and prosperous, and utterly incapable of protecting its youth.","Seierstad delivers a devastating account of the 2011 Norway attacks, examining both the terrorist's radicalization and his victims' lives.

All the while, she immerses herself in the history of the Southern Territory, a fascist theocracy that split from the rest of the country after World War II, as it is finally forced into an uneasy reunification in the present day.

9780525657743,Crying in H Mart,A Memoir,"In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling musician. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids in Eugene, Oregon, struggling with her mother's particular expectations and navigating a painful adolescence. She treasures memories of months spent in her grandmother's tiny Seoul apartment, where she and her mother would bond late into the night over heaping plates of food.

As she moved to the East Coast for college, worked in restaurants, and performed with her fledgling band, her Koreanness began to feel increasingly distant—even as she found the life she wanted to live. Her mother's terminal cancer diagnosis when Michelle was twenty-five forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.

Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice radiates as brilliantly on the page as it does onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes and family photos, this is a memoir to cherish and reread.","From Japanese Breakfast's Michelle Zauner comes a luminous memoir exploring Korean American identity through the lens of food and family.

Two years into the war, the conflict has grown far more complex. King George III remains determined to crush his rebellious colonies, but fighting across the Atlantic has become ruinously expensive. Worse still, spies report that France and Spain threaten to join the American cause.

9780871403131,Shirley Jackson,A Rather Haunted Life,"Still known to millions primarily as the author of ""The Lottery,"" Shirley Jackson (1916–1965) has been curiously absent from the mainstream American literary canon. A genius of literary suspense and psychological horror, Jackson plumbed the cultural anxiety of postwar America more deeply than anyone.

Biographer Ruth Franklin reveals the tumultuous life and inner darkness of the author of such classics as The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Placing Jackson within an American Gothic tradition that stretches back to Hawthorne and Poe, Franklin demonstrates how her unique contribution came from her focus on ""domestic horror."" Almost two decades before The Feminine Mystique ignited the women's movement, Jackson's stories were already exploring the exploitation and desperate isolation of women in American society.

The increasingly prescient Jackson emerges as a ferociously talented writer in a time when it was unusual for a woman to have both family and profession. A mother of four and wife of prominent New Yorker critic Stanley Edgar Hyman, she lived a seemingly bucolic life in Vermont. Yet much like her stories, which channeled the occult while exploring the claustrophobia of marriage and motherhood, Jackson's creative ascent was haunted by darkness. Her marriage became tenuous, her anxiety mounted, and she became addicted to amphetamines and tranquilizers.

Based on previously undiscovered correspondence and dozens of new interviews, this becomes the definitive biography of an American literary giant.","Ruth Franklin's masterful biography rescues Shirley Jackson from literary obscurity, revealing how the author of The Lottery and The Haunting of Hill House pioneered domestic horror while navigating the contradictions of mid-century American womanhood.",624,,Biography & Autobiography / Literary Figures,Liveright,27/09/2016,Ruth Franklin,"Ruth Franklin is the author of A Thousand Darknesses: Lies and Truth in Holocaust Fiction, a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature, and Shirley Jackson: A Rather Haunted Life, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography. She lives in Brooklyn, NY.","""With this welcome new biography Franklin makes a thoughtful and persuasive case for Jackson as a serious and accomplished literary artist. . . . [Franklin] sees Jackson not as an oddball, one-off writer of horror tales and ghost stories but as someone belonging to the great tradition of Hawthorne, Poe and James, writers preoccupied, as she was, with inner evil in the human soul.""

—Charles McGrath, The New York Times

""Ruth Franklin's sympathetic and masterful biography both uncovers Jackson's secret and haunting life and repositions her as a major artist whose fiction so uncannily channeled women's nightmares and contradictions that it is 'nothing less than the secret history of American women of her era.'""

—Elaine Showalter, The Washington Post

""This meticulous biography tackles the work of Shirley Jackson with the kind of studied seriousness some might give to a male titan of history like Robert Moses. And thank goddess for that, as Ruth Franklin wisely rescues Shirley Jackson from any semblance of obscurity. Despite her well-documented magnetism (and dalliances in the dark arts) Jackson's work was often dismissed as mere genre nonsense or, worse yet, women's fiction and Franklin's sensitive, witty and rigorous work makes an airtight case for just why this isn't right. The ire Jackson's short stories inspired in New Yorker readers is only a hint of the drama and intensity that characterized her short but beguiling life, with Franklin captures with a hefty dose of wit and suspense. One of the best literary biographies I've ever encountered.""

Four years later, with nothing left to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State.

She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than ""an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise."" But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.

Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and crushing loneliness of the trail. Told with suspense and sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.","Following her mother's death and the collapse of her marriage, Cheryl Strayed embarks on an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. A blazingly honest memoir about breaking down and building back up again.",336,,Biography & Autobiography / Memoirs,Knopf,20/03/2012,Cheryl Strayed,"Cheryl Strayed is the author of the number-one New York Times bestseller Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, which has sold more than four million copies worldwide and was made into an Oscar-nominated film. Tiny Beautiful Things was adapted as a play and Hulu series. She's also the author of Brave Enough and the novel Torch, and has hosted the podcasts Sugar Calling and Dear Sugars. She lives in Portland, Oregon.","""A rich, riveting true story . . . During her grueling three-month journey, Strayed circled around black bears and rattlesnakes, fought extreme dehydration by drinking oily gray pond water, and hiked in boots made entirely of duct tape.  Reading her matter-of-fact take on love and grief and the soul-saving quality of a Snapple lemonade, you can understand why Strayed has earned a cult following as the author of Dear Sugar, a popular advice column on therumpus.net. . . . With its vivid descriptions of beautiful but unforgiving terrain, Wild is a cinematic story, but Strayed's book isn't really about big, cathartic moments. The author never 'finds herself' or gets healed. When she reaches the trail's end, she buys a cheap ice cream cone and continues down the road. . . . It's hard to imagine anything more important than taking one step at a time. That's endurance, and that's what Strayed understands, almost 20 years later. As she writes, 'There was only one [option], I knew. To keep walking.""

—Melissa Maerz, Entertainment Weekly

""In the summer of 1995, at age 26 and feeling at the end of her rope emotionally, Strayed resolved to hike solo the Pacific Crest Trail . . . In this detailed, in-the-moment re-enactment, she delineates the travails and triumphs of those three grueling months. Living in Minneapolis, on the verge of divorcing her husband, Strayed was still reeling from the sudden death four years before of her mother; the ensuing years formed an erratic, confused time 'like a crackling Fourth of July sparkler.' Hiking the trail helped decide what direction her life would take, even though she had never seriously hiked or carried a pack before. . . . Eventually she began to experience 'a kind of strange, abstract, retrospective fun,' meeting the few other hikers along the way, all male; jettisoning some of the weight from her pack and burning books she had read; and encountering all manner of creature and acts of nature, from rock slides to snow. Her account forms a charming, intrepid trial by fire, as she emerges from the ordeal bruised but not beaten, changed, a lone survivor.""

—Publishers Weekly

""Unsentimental memoir of the author's solo hike from California to Washington along the Pacific Crest Trail. Following the death of her mother, Strayed's life quickly disintegrated. . . . While waiting in line at an outdoors store, [she] read the back cover of a book about the Pacific Crest Trail. Initially, the idea of hiking the trail became a vague apparition, then a goal. Woefully underprepared for the wilderness, out of shape and carrying a ridiculously overweight pack, the author set out from the small California town of Mojave, toward a bridge ('the Bridge of the Gods') crossing the Columbia River at the Oregon-Washington border. Strayed's writing admirably conveys the rigors and rewards of long-distance hiking. Along the way she suffered aches, pains, loneliness, blistered, bloody feet and persistent hunger. Yet the author also discovered a newfound sense of awe . . . stunned by how the trail both shattered and sheltered her. Most of the hikers she met along the way were helpful, and she also encountered instances of trail magic . . . A candid, inspiring narrative of the author's brutal physical and psychological journey through a wilderness of despair to a renewed sense of self.""

Drawing on deep original reporting and unpublished journals and memoirs, Rachel Aviv explores people who have come up against the limits of how we understand mental illness.

She follows an Indian woman celebrated as a saint who lives in healing temples in Kerala; an incarcerated mother seeking her children's forgiveness after recovering from psychosis; a man who devotes his life to revenge against his psychoanalysts; and an affluent young woman who goes off her medication after a decade of defining herself through her diagnosis.

Animated by profound empathy, Aviv's exploration is refracted through her own experience of living in a psychiatric ward at age six and meeting a fellow patient whose life runs parallel to hers—until it no longer does. She asks how the stories we tell about mental disorders shape their course in our lives and our identities. Challenging how we understand and discuss illness, this is a testament to the porousness and resilience of the mind.","What happens when psychiatric explanations fail to capture who we really are?

9781416590316,Frederick Douglass,Prophet of Freedom,"Born into slavery, Frederick Douglass (1818–1895) escaped from Baltimore as a young man, armed with literacy secretly taught by his owner's wife. He would become one of America's major literary figures, his very existence challenging the lies slaveholders told about Black humanity.

Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass transformed his personal story into a powerful weapon against slavery. By the Civil War, he had become the nation's most celebrated orator, traveling widely to bear witness to slavery's brutality. In his unique and eloquent voice, Douglass emerged as both a fierce critic of America and a radical patriot.

David Blight's masterful biography draws on previously untapped private collections and recently discovered issues of Douglass's own newspapers. The result is an intimate portrait that reveals Douglass's complex family life, his two marriages, and his sometimes contentious relationships with younger African Americans after the war, even as he never abandoned his commitment to civil rights and the Republican party.","The definitive biography of Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery to become America's greatest 19th-century orator and a towering abolitionist.

But when Mungo's mother sends him on a fishing trip to a remote loch with two strange men, he will need all his strength and courage to find his way back to a place where he and James might still have a future.

At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it's also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment—immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma—the novel is undergirded by compassion and tenderness.

With stunning urgency and grace, Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, asking how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are.

He popularized martial arts in the West, bridged Eastern and Western cultures, and was poised to conquer Hollywood when cerebral edema claimed his life at thirty-two. His legend has only grown since—but it has also eclipsed the man himself.

Forgotten is the reality of a baby born in segregated San Francisco who spent his youth in war-ravaged, fight-crazy Hong Kong. Forgotten is the curious teenager who returned to America, embracing West Coast counterculture while staying rooted in Asian philosophies. Forgotten is the man whose very presence broke barriers and helped define what it meant to be Asian in America at the dawn of Asian America.

Water Mirror Echo—titled after Lee's own philosophy of movement and response—reclaims that story. Award-winning author Jeff Chang, whose cultural criticism has made him one of our most distinctive voices, brings authenticity and depth to Lee's biography.

9781631498831,On Juneteenth,,"Weaving together American history, family chronicle, and memoir, Annette Gordon-Reed's On Juneteenth provides a historian's view of the country's long road to this pivotal moment. She recounts both the holiday's origins in Texas and the enormous hardships African Americans endured in the century since, from Reconstruction through Jim Crow and beyond.

All too aware of the cowboy and oil baron stories that dominate Texas lore, Gordon-Reed—a Texas native and descendant of people enslaved in the state as early as the 1820s—forges a new and profoundly truthful narrative of her home state, with implications for us all.

Combining personal anecdotes with historical facts, Gordon-Reed shows how African Americans played an integral role in the Texas story, from their earliest presence to June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of legalized slavery in Galveston. Reworking the traditional ""Alamo"" framework, she demonstrates that the slave-based economy not only defined Texas independence but precipitated the Mexican-American War and Civil War itself.

No one thought much about what had happened to the twenty-four-year-old: she was a Craigslist escort who had been fleeing a scene—of what, no one could be sure.

Seven months later, an unexpected discovery in a bramble alongside a nearby highway turned up four bodies, all evenly spaced, all wrapped in burlap. But none of them Shannan's. There was Maureen Brainard-Barnes, last seen at Penn Station three years earlier, and Melissa Barthelemy, last seen in the Bronx in 2009. There was Megan Waterman, last seen leaving a hotel in Hauppauge, and Amber Lynn Costello, last seen leaving a house in West Babylon.

9780063112049,By the Fire We Carry,The Generations-Long Fight for Justice on Native Land,"Before 2020, American Indian reservations made up roughly 55 million acres of land in the United States. Nearly 200 million acres are reserved for National Forests—in the emergence of this great nation, our government set aside more land for trees than for Indigenous peoples.

In the 1830s, Muscogee people were rounded up by the US military at gunpoint and forced into exile halfway across the continent. They were promised this new land would be theirs for as long as the grass grew and the waters ran. But that promise was not kept. When Oklahoma was created on top of Muscogee land, the new state claimed their reservation no longer existed.

Over a century later, a Muscogee citizen was sentenced to death for murdering another Muscogee citizen on tribal land. His defense attorneys argued the murder occurred on tribal reservation land, meaning Oklahoma didn't have jurisdiction to execute him. Oklahoma asserted that the reservation no longer existed. In summer 2020, the Supreme Court settled the dispute with a ruling that would ultimately underpin multiple reservations covering almost half the land in Oklahoma, including Nagle's own Cherokee Nation.

Here Rebecca Nagle recounts the generations-long fight for tribal land and sovereignty in eastern Oklahoma. By chronicling both contemporary legal battles and historic acts of Indigenous resistance, By the Fire We Carry stands as a landmark work of American history that exposes the wrongs our nation has committed and the Native-led battle for justice that has shaped our country.",How a small-town murder in the 1990s led to a Supreme Court case that redrew the map of Oklahoma.

She knows that her real name is Purity, that she's saddled with $130,000 in student debt, that she's squatting with anarchists in Oakland, and that her relationship with her mother—her only family—is hazardous. But she doesn't have a clue who her father is, why her mother chose to live as a recluse with an invented name, or how she'll ever have a normal life.

Enter the Germans. A glancing encounter with a German peace activist leads Pip to an internship in South America with the Sunlight Project, an organization that traffics in all the secrets of the world—including, Pip hopes, the secret of her origins. TSP is the brainchild of Andreas Wolf, a charismatic provocateur who rose to fame in the chaos following the fall of the Berlin Wall.

9781631494420,Audience of One,"Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America","Television has entertained America, television has ensorcelled America, and with the election of Donald J. Trump, television has conquered America. In Audience of One, New York Times chief television critic James Poniewozik traces the history of TV and mass media from the Reagan era to today, explaining how a volcanic, camera-hogging antihero merged with America’s most powerful medium to become our forty-fifth president.

In the tradition of Neil Postman’s masterpiece Amusing Ourselves to Death, Audience of One shows how American media have shaped American society and politics, by interweaving two crucial stories. The first story follows the evolution of television from the three-network era of the 20th century, which joined millions of Americans in a shared monoculture, into today’s zillion-channel, Internet-atomized universe, which sliced and diced them into fractious, alienated subcultures. The second story is a cultural critique of Donald Trump, the chameleonic celebrity who courted fame, achieved a mind-meld with the media beast, and rode it to ultimate power.

Braiding together these disparate threads, Poniewozik combines a cultural history of modern America with a revelatory portrait of the most public American who has ever lived. Reaching back to the 1940s, when Trump and commercial television were born, Poniewozik illustrates how Donald became “a character that wrote itself, a brand mascot that jumped off the cereal box and entered the world, a simulacrum that replaced the thing it represented.” Viscerally attuned to the media, Trump shape-shifted into a boastful tabloid playboy in the 1980s; a self-parodic sitcom fixture in the 1990s; a reality-TV “You’re Fired” machine in the 2000s; and finally, the biggest role of his career, a Fox News–obsessed, Twitter-mad, culture-warring demagogue in the White House.

Poniewozik deconstructs the chaotic Age of Trump as the 24-hour TV production that it is, decoding an era when politics has become pop culture, and vice versa. Trenchant and often slyly hilarious, Audience of One is a penetrating and sobering review of the raucous, raging, farcical reality show—performed for the benefit of an insomniac, cable-news-junkie “audience of one”—that we all came to live in, whether we liked it or not.",An incisive cultural history that captures a fractious nation through the prism of television and the rattled mind of a celebrity president.,304,,Political Science / Political Process / Media & Internet,Liveright,10/09/2019,James Poniewozik,James Poniewozik has been the chief television critic of the New York Times since 2015. He was previously the television and media critic for Time magazine and media columnist for Salon.

His telling analyses of Trump’s appearances on The Apprentice, Fox & Friends, and The Howard Stern Show will come as revelations to readers unfamiliar with those programs.... The author chronicles Trump’s actions against a deeply insightful history of vast changes in the media and popular culture during the period.... This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base.""—Kirkus

""Caustic, scintillating cultural history…. New York Times television critic Poniewozik sets Donald Trump’s political rise against American television’s evolution…. Trump’s own media persona—'the blunt, impolite apex predator’ on The Apprentice, the trash-talking bully in pro-wrestling cameos, the birther conspiracy theorist on Fox News guest spots—shaped his political style and then subsumed him entirely: Trump became ‘a cable news channel in human form: loud, short of attention span, and addicted to conflict,’ Poniewozik writes. ‘TV became president.’ Poniewozik’s trenchant, brilliantly witty critique of the cultural archetypes percolating into American politics is one of the best analyses yet of the Trump era.""—Publishers Weekly

Scientists recently invented the term ""megafire"" to describe wildfires that behave in ways that would have been nearly impossible just a generation ago—burning through winter, exploding in the night, and devastating landscapes historically impervious to incendiary destruction.

In When It All Burns, wildland firefighter and anthropologist Jordan Thomas recounts a single, brutal six-month fire season with the Los Padres Hotshots—the special forces of America's firefighters. Being a hotshot is among the most difficult jobs on earth. Thomas viscerally renders his crew's attempts to battle flames that are often too destructive to contain.

He uncovers the hidden cultural history of megafires, revealing how humanity's symbiotic relationship with wildfire became a war—and what can be done to change it back.

It's an immersive story of community in the most perilous of circumstances, told with humor, humility, and affection.","Wildland firefighter and anthropologist Jordan Thomas chronicles one brutal fire season with California's elite hotshot crew.

With no TV, internet, or cell service, the truth becomes unknowable. Should Amanda and Clay trust these strangers who've invaded their vacation? What's really happening back in New York? And in this isolated house, cut off from civilization, are either family truly safe—from whatever's out there, or from each other?

9780593701522,Searches,Selfhood in the Digital Age,"When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, it awakened the world to a secretive project: teaching AI-powered machines to write. Its creators had a sweeping ambition—to build machines that could not only communicate, but could do all kinds of activities better than humans ever could. But was this goal actually achievable? And if reached, would it lead to our liberation or our subjugation?

Vauhini Vara, an award-winning tech journalist, had long been grappling with these questions. In 2021, she asked a predecessor of ChatGPT to write about her sister's death, resulting in an essay that was both more moving and more disturbing than she could have imagined. It quickly went viral.

The experience forced Vara to interrogate how these technologies have influenced her understanding of herself and the world around her—from discovering online chat rooms as a preteen, to serving as the Wall Street Journal's first Facebook reporter, to asking ChatGPT for writing advice. Interspersed throughout this investigation are her own Google searches, Amazon reviews, and other raw material of internet life, including the viral AI experiment that started it all.

Searches illuminates how technological capitalism is both shaping and exploiting human existence, while proposing that by harnessing our collective creativity, we might imagine a freer, more empowered relationship with our machines and each other.","A tech journalist uses her own viral AI experiment—asking ChatGPT's predecessor to write about her sister's death—as a starting point to examine how technology companies have shaped our inner lives.

The inheritance connects him to his school days and first love, dredging up events involving his closest childhood friends—one now dead, another disturbingly present. As Tony revisits what he thought he knew about those formative years, he begins to question not just his memories, but his understanding of his own character.

Now, in Under the Skin, Villarosa exposes the systemic forces that cause Black people to ""live sicker and die quicker"" compared to their white counterparts. Today's medical texts and instruments still carry slavery-era assumptions that Black bodies are fundamentally different from white bodies.

Posing as master and slave while sustained by their love as husband and wife, they escaped together across more than 1,000 miles, traveling openly on steamboats, carriages, and trains from bondage in Georgia to freedom in the North.

Along the way, they dodged slave traders, military officers, and even friends of their enslavers who might have revealed their true identities. Their adventure soon made them celebrities, generating headlines nationwide. Americans couldn't get enough of this charismatic young couple, who traveled another 1,000 miles crisscrossing New England, drawing thunderous applause as they spoke alongside abolitionist luminaries like Frederick Douglass and William Wells Brown.

But danger persisted. With the infamous Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, all Americans became accountable for returning refugees like the Crafts to slavery. When slave hunters came up from Georgia, the Crafts fled again—this time from the United States itself, with thousands of lives hanging in the balance.

King reveals a minister wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death.

9780061988349,Lost in Shangri-La,"A True Story of Survival, Adventure, and the Most Incredible Rescue Mission of World War II","On May 13, 1945, twenty-four officers and enlisted personnel stationed on Dutch New Guinea boarded a transport plane for a sightseeing trip over ""Shangri-La""—a beautiful, mysterious valley surrounded by jagged mountain peaks deep within uncharted jungle. Named after the fabled paradise in Lost Horizon, this hidden retreat was home to Stone Age warriors rumored to be headhunters and cannibals.

The pleasure tour became a battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers survived: WAC Corporal Margaret Hastings, Lieutenant John McCollom, and Sergeant Kenneth Decker. Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to disease and parasites in the wet jungle climate, the trio faced certain death unless they left the wreckage.

Caught between hostile tribes and enemy Japanese forces, with nothing but a handful of candy and their own fortitude, they endured a harrowing trek down the mountainside into unknown territory. Their journey led them straight into a primitive tribe who had never seen white people.

Drawn from personal interviews, declassified Army documents, and original film footage, Zuckoff reveals how the determined survivors traversed dense jungle to find help, how Filipino-American paratroopers risked their lives for a rescue mission, and how the Americans eventually befriended a noble native chief and his people.","When a WWII sightseeing flight crashes in uncharted New Guinea jungle, three survivors must navigate hostile terrain and Stone Age tribes to stay alive.

She's an American actress, he discovers—beautiful, mysterious, and dying.

Fifty years later, an elderly Italian man appears on a Hollywood studio's back lot, searching for the woman he last saw at his hotel decades before.

What unfolds is a dazzling, deeply human novel populated by Walter's trademark unforgettable characters: the Italian innkeeper and his enigmatic beauty, a heroically cynical film producer who once brought them together, his idealistic young assistant, and the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers who inhabit their world across the decades. Gloriously inventive and constantly surprising, Beautiful Ruins follows flawed yet utterly relatable people all reaching toward impossible dreams, leading us up a rocky shoreline path toward a future both distant and achingly familiar.","An almost-love affair begins on the Italian Riviera in 1962 and resurfaces in contemporary Hollywood fifty years later.

9780300244052,The Rediscovery of America,Native Peoples and the Unmaking of U.S. History,"The most enduring feature of U.S. history is the presence of Native Americans, yet most histories have focused on Europeans and their descendants. This long neglect is changing as a new generation of scholars insists that any full account of America must address the struggle, survival, and resurgence of Indigenous nations.

In this transformative synthesis, Ned Blackhawk interweaves five centuries of Native and non-Native histories—from Spanish colonial exploration to the rise of Native self-determination in the twentieth century—to show how Native peoples have shaped the nation at every turn. He demonstrates that European colonization in the 1600s was never predetermined; that Native nations influenced England's crisis of empire; that the first shots of the American Revolution were prompted by Indian affairs; that California Indians were among the first casualties of the Civil War; and that twentieth-century activists refashioned American law and policy.

Blackhawk's retelling acknowledges the enduring power, agency, and survival of Indigenous peoples, offering a truer account of the United States and revealing anew the varied meanings of America.","Five centuries of American history retold with Indigenous peoples at the center.

Reorienting the history of America as foremost that of an Indigenous colony, Blackhawk calls for a fundamental change of perspective.""

""Even as the telling of American history has become more complex and nuanced, Native Americans tend to be absent. Blackhawk, a professor at Yale, confronts that absence in this sweeping account of how Native Americans shaped the country legally, politically, and culturally.""

""A thoughtful, innovative, and provocative book. . . .

The pair steals away to remote forests and vast deserts, London fashion shows and Berlin sex clubs, dinner parties, back alleys, East Village hotel rooms, and San Francisco dives. Finding no other way to stay together, they shack up illicitly among unlikely allies in a ""city of refuge.""

With Atherton Lin's inimitable blend of tenderness and wicked humor, Deep House moves through the couple's string of rented apartments while unlocking doors to a lineage of gay men who have come before—smuggling foreign partners through national checkpoints or going public to stand up for the right to get down in the privacy of their own homes. They include hapless criminals, sexpot bartenders, friars, pirates, government workers who subverted the system, activists who went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the celebrated artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres.

Deep House juxtaposes whispered disclosures of undocumented domesticity with courtroom drama and political stunts to explore myriad forms of intimacy while questioning the mechanisms that legitimize love. At once a historical kaleidoscope and the innermost tale of two boyfriends who made a home in the shadows of a turbulent civil rights battle.","When Congress threatens to tear apart same-sex couples with the Defense of Marriage Act, two lovers go underground in 1990s San Francisco.

9780374228347,Outline,,"A man and a woman are seated next to each other on a plane. They get to talking—about their destination, their careers, their families. Grievances are aired, family tragedies discussed, marriages and divorces analyzed. An intimacy is established as two strangers contrast their own fictions about their lives.

Rachel Cusk's Outline is a novel in ten conversations. Spare and stark, it follows a novelist teaching a creative writing course during one oppressively hot summer in Athens. She leads students in storytelling exercises, meets other visiting writers for dinner, goes swimming in the Ionian Sea with her neighbor from the plane. The people she encounters speak volubly about themselves: their fantasies, anxieties, pet theories, regrets, and longings.

Through these disclosures, a portrait of the narrator emerges by contrast—a woman learning to face a great loss. Outline takes a hard look at the things that are hardest to speak about, brilliantly capturing conversations and investigating people's motivations for storytelling. It questions their ability to ever do so honestly or unselfishly, baring the deepest impulses behind the craft of fiction writing.","A writer travels to Athens to teach a writing course. Instead of telling her own story, she listens as others reveal theirs. Spare yet layered, Outline is a meditation on identity, perception, and the act of storytelling.",256,Outline Trilogy,Fiction / Literary,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",13/01/2015,Rachel Cusk,"Rachel Cusk is the author of Second Place, the Outline trilogy, the memoirs A Life's Work and Aftermath, and several other works of fiction and nonfiction.

Its conversations echo each other deftly, their acute insights gracefully pulling apart the seams of its carefully composed characters to show glimpses of much messier selves within: a series of searing psychic X-rays bleached by coastal light.""

—Leslie Jamison, author of The Empathy Exams

""Like the Higgs boson, which appears only when bombarded by electrons, Rachel Cusk's nearly nameless narrator flickers into visibility only through her encounters with a series of amazingly eloquent and fascinating interlocutors. Writing at the highest level and with the greatest technical restraint, Cusk manages to describe the painful realities of women's lives by a process of erasure that is itself responsible for that suffering. This is a novel where form and content meld so perfectly as to collapse into each other. I am so much the better for having read it. As if someone finally told me the truth by telling me everything, and nothing.""

—Jeffrey Eugenides, author of The Marriage Plot

""Outline, in the most seemingly effortless way imaginable, winds up being completely captivating: the conversations are autobiographies in miniature, with all the holes, lies and self-deceptions lurking in that wily form . . . As you'd expect in a novel so obsessed with language, Cusk's own writing is a pleasure to read -- unfailingly precise and surprising . . . The ultimate and undeniably cerebral pleasure of Outline is it nudges you into being a more attentive reader and listener, more alert to the cracks in sentences and the messier realities that words can only try to contain.""

9781524748173,Constructing a Nervous System,A Memoir,"Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Margo Jefferson crafts a stunning follow-up to Negroland that reads like no memoir you've encountered before. She fragments herself on the page, weaving together cultural criticism, family grief, and pivotal life moments into something entirely new.

This isn't traditional memoir—it's a performance of memory itself. Jefferson inhabits her influences: Bing Crosby and Ike Turner become alter egos, jazz records transform into parental voices, W.E.B. Du Bois meets George Eliot in imagined encounters. She splices a ballerina's movements with an Olympic runner's stride, creating a template for Black female embodiment.

The result is wildly innovative—defined by fractures and dissonance, longing and ecstasy. Jefferson interrogates not just her own identity but the very act of memoir writing, probing the fissures at the center of American cultural life. She examines how we're shaped by the figures who thrill and trouble us, from family members to jazz luminaries to literary giants, creating a vital apparatus of selfhood that's both deeply personal and universally resonant.","Jefferson fragments herself on the page, weaving cultural criticism with personal history in a memoir unlike any other.

Jenny Offill's heroine, referred to simply as ""the wife,"" once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation—their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and long relationships. As they confront common catastrophes—a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions—the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to Stoic thought experiments to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts.

She muses on the consuming experience of maternal love and the near total destruction of self that ensues, confronting the friction between domestic life and the seductions of art. With cool precision and language that shimmers with rage, wit, and fierce longing, Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story with the velocity of a train hurtling through the night.

Mrs. Touchet is a woman of many interests: literature, justice, abolitionism, class, her cousin, his wives, this life and the next. But she is also skeptical. She suspects her cousin of having no talent, his successful friend Mr. Charles Dickens of being a bully and a moralist, and England of being a land of facades where nothing is quite what it seems.

Andrew Bogle, meanwhile, grew up enslaved on the Hope Plantation, Jamaica. He knows every lump of sugar comes at a human cost, that the rich deceive the poor, and that people are more easily manipulated than they realize. When Bogle finds himself in London as star witness in a celebrated case of imposture, he knows his future depends on telling the right story.

The ""Tichborne Trial""—wherein a lower-class butcher from Australia claimed he was the rightful heir of a sizable estate and title—captivates Mrs. Touchet and all of England. Is Sir Roger Tichborne really who he says he is? Or is he a fraud? In a world of hypocrisy and self-deception, deciding what is real proves a complicated task.

Based on real historical events, The Fraud is a dazzling novel about truth and fiction, Jamaica and Britain, fraudulence and authenticity, and the mystery of ""other people.""","Set against the legal trial that divided Victorian England, Smith weaves together the stories of a skeptical Scottish housekeeper and a formerly enslaved Jamaican man navigating questions of truth, authenticity, and who gets to be believed.",464,,Fiction / Literary,Penguin Press,05/09/2023,Zadie Smith,"Zadie Smith is the author of the novels White Teeth, The Autograph Man, On Beauty, NW, Swing Time, and The Fraud; the novella The Embassy of Cambodia; three essay collections, Changing My Mind, Feel Free and Intimations; the short story collection Grand Union; and the play The Wife of Willesden, adapted from Chaucer.

Each moment he examines—whether it's the twenty-seven seconds in ""Gimme Shelter"" when Merry Clayton wails ""rape, murder,"" a schoolyard fistfight, a dance marathon, or the instant in a spades game right after cards are dealt—carries layers of resonance across Black and white cultures, American politics, and Abdurraqib's own history of love, grief, and performance.

Iran boasted the world's fifth largest army, billions in oil revenues, and a booming capital dotted with construction cranes. The regime's secret police had crushed opposition, and the Shah seemed both invulnerable and invaluable as a Cold War ally.

Fourteen months later, the Shah fled into exile, overthrown by a volcanic religious revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini. The ensuing hostage crisis forever damaged America's standing. How could the United States, with one of its largest CIA stations and thousands of military personnel in Iran, have been so catastrophically blind?

Scott Anderson weaves a spellbinding tale of a dictator oblivious to his subjects' disdain and a superpower blundering into disaster. With the narrative brio and keen analysis that made his Lawrence in Arabia a modern classic, Anderson argues that the Iranian Revolution was as world-shattering as the French and Russian revolutions.

Overnight, Joe's world crumbles. His strong mother retreats to bed, slipping into depression, while his father struggles with anger and grief, trying to maintain normalcy. Feeling increasingly alone, Joe is thrust into an adult world he's unprepared for.

With Joe's help, Bazil searches through legal decisions for clues to the attacker's identity and answers to crucial questions: Was the perpetrator Indian or white? Where exactly was the crime committed—on state or tribal land? Who should investigate—tribal police, state, or federal authorities?

Frustrated by his father's limitations and hungry for justice, Joe sets out with friends Cappy, Zack, and Angus to find the truth. Their quest begins at the Round House, a sacred Ojibwe space, and becomes a journey of discovery that will transform them all.

Erdrich's masterful novel illuminates the harsh realities of a community where Ojibwe and white live uneasily together, blending tragedy and comedy with a spirit world very much present in its all-too-human characters' lives.","When his mother is brutally attacked on their North Dakota reservation, thirteen-year-old Joe embarks on a dangerous quest for justice.

Bell examines how ""the talk"" has shaped nearly every moment of his life into adulthood and fatherhood.

With How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, his first nonfiction collection, he establishes himself as one of our finest essayists.

This is Chee's manifesto on the entangling of life, literature, and politics—how lessons learned from reading and writing fiction have transformed him. These essays trace his evolution from student to teacher, reader to writer, as he reckons with his identities as son, gay man, Korean American, artist, activist, lover, and friend.

He examines formative experiences from his life and the nation's history: his father's death, the AIDS crisis, 9/11, the jobs that supported his writing—Tarot-reading, bookselling, cater-waiting for William F. Buckley—the creation of his first novel Edinburgh, and Trump's election.

By turns commanding, heartbreaking, and wry, these essays ask essential questions about how we create ourselves in life and art, and how to fight when our dearest truths are under attack.","Chee traces his evolution from student to teacher through luminous essays that blend personal narrative with reflections on politics, art, and identity.

If he's not already a household name, he needs to be…powerful, powerful essays with powerful, powerful words…""

—Isaac Fitzgerald, NBC

""If writing, too, is a form of drag for Chee, it is also an act of mystic invocation and transference...Chee leavens his heaviest topics—the decimation of the gay community in the late 1980s and early '90s, the repressed memory of sexual abuse that inspired Edinburgh—with charming episodes like his stint as a waiter at William and Pat Buckley's Park Avenue maisonette, a job that prompted a crisis of conscience given Buckley's infamous proposal to brand AIDS patients on their wrists and buttocks...Even at his most mystical, Chee is generous; these pieces are personal, never pedagogical. They bespeak an unguarded sincerity and curiosity. Chee is refreshingly open about his sometimes liberating, sometimes claustrophobic sense of exceptionality...He reminds us that whomever a writer pictures as his audience, he is also writing into absence, standing in testimony for the sake of the dead. Like most of the essays here, 'After Peter' pulses with urgency, one piece from a life in restless motion. It is not necessary to agree that How to Write an Autobiographical Novel is itself a kind of novel in order to appreciate that Chee has written a moving and personal tribute to impermanence, a wise and transgressive meditation on a life lived both because of and in spite of America, a place where, he writes, you are allowed to speak the truth as long as nothing changes.""

""Two-thirds of the way through Alexander Chee's How to Write an Autobiographical Novel, I abandoned my sharpened reviewer's pencil in favor of luxuriating in the words. Chee's writing has a mesmerizing quality; his sentences are rife with profound truths without lapsing into the didactic...Chee is a very special artist; his writing is lyrical and accessible, whimsical and sad, often all at the same time. No doubt he is an inspiring writing teacher as well. His views on writing reflect his own, thoughtfully examined life.""

9780316561693,All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days,The True Story of the American Woman at the Heart of the German Resistance to Hitler,"Born and raised in Milwaukee, Mildred Harnack was twenty-six when she enrolled in a PhD program in Germany and witnessed the meteoric rise of the Nazi party. In 1932, she began holding secret meetings in her apartment—a small band of political activists that by 1940 had grown into the largest underground resistance group in Berlin.

She recruited working-class Germans into the resistance, helped Jews escape, plotted acts of sabotage, and collaborated in writing leaflets that denounced Hitler and called for revolution. Her coconspirators circulated through Berlin under cover of night, slipping the leaflets into mailboxes, public restrooms, phone booths. When the Second World War began, she became a spy, couriering top-secret intelligence to the Allies.

On the eve of her escape to Sweden, she was ambushed by the Gestapo. At a Nazi military court, five judges sentenced her to six years at a prison camp, but Hitler overruled the decision and ordered her execution. On February 16, 1943, she was strapped to a guillotine and beheaded.

Historians identify Mildred Harnack as the only American in the leadership of the German resistance, yet her remarkable story has remained almost unknown until now. Her great-great-niece Rebecca Donner draws on extensive archival research and newly uncovered family documents to reconstruct this astonishing story, brilliantly interweaving letters, diary entries, notes smuggled out of prison, and declassified intelligence documents into a powerful epic about moral courage.","The astonishing true story of Mildred Harnack, the only American to lead German resistance against Hitler.

He was also perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history, implicated in the deaths of as many as 400 patients across sixteen years and nine hospitals.

Charles Graeber's riveting investigation exposes how Cullen was repeatedly shielded by a medical system more concerned with reputation than patient safety. Drawing on hundreds of pages of police records, wiretaps, videotapes, and exclusive jailhouse interviews with Cullen himself, Graeber reveals the chilling secrets behind these crimes.

At the heart of the story is Amy, a fellow nurse torn between loyalty to her friend and the lives hanging in the balance. Her courage, along with that of determined detectives, ultimately brought Cullen's killing spree to an end.

But even those inspired by Lorde's teachings on ""the creative power of difference"" may be missing something fundamental about her life and work.

Lorde's understanding of survival wasn't simply about getting through oppression or being resilient in the face of cancer. It was about the total stakes of what it means to be in relationship with a planet in transformation. The focus on Lorde's quotable essays, to the neglect of her complex poems, has led us to ignore her deep engagement with the natural world—the planetary dynamics of geology, meteorology, and biology. For her, ecological images weren't simply metaphors but literal guides to how to be of earth on earth, and how to survive with the ethics that a Black feminist lesbian warrior poetics demands.

In Survival Is a Promise, Alexis Pauline Gumbs—the first researcher to explore the full depths of Lorde's manuscript archives—illuminates the eternal life of Lorde. Her life and work become more than a sound bite; they become a cosmic force, teaching us the grand contingency of life together on earth.","Drawing on previously unexplored archives, Gumbs reveals how Audre Lorde's ecological vision offers radical lessons for surviving on a planet in transformation.

Was it connected to his friend Ruprecht Van Doren, an overweight genius obsessed with opening a portal to parallel universes using string theory? Could it involve Carl, the psychotic teenage drug dealer who's Skippy's rival for the same girl? Or does ""the Automator""—the ruthlessly ambitious headmaster hell-bent on modernizing the school—have blood on his hands?

Murray's dazzling novel unravels this mystery while exploring how the boys of Seabrook connect to their parents and teachers in ways nobody could imagine. With an unforgettable cast—from hip-hop-loving Eoin ""MC Sexecutioner"" Flynn to basketball-playing midget Philip Kilfether—and packed with everything from Ritalin to M-theory to Robert Frost's hidden meanings, this is both a hilarious portrait of adolescent chaos and a tragic indictment of a world that sacrifices its most vulnerable members.","When Skippy dies in a Dublin doughnut shop, his death unravels the lives of students and teachers at an elite Irish boarding school.

Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of the crew, which included New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. Like the assassination of JFK, the Challenger disaster became a defining moment in 20th-century history—one that forever changed America's optimistic view of the future.

Based on extensive archival research and meticulous reporting, Challenger follows the seven doomed crew members and other key figures through the years leading up to the accident. Higginbotham offers a detailed account of the tragedy itself and the investigation afterward—a compelling tale of ambition and ingenuity undermined by political cynicism and cost-cutting. Throughout, ominous warning signs emerge, recognized but then ignored, later hidden from the public.

The book reveals the shuttle program's history and the lives of men and women whose stories have been overshadowed by disaster, as well as the designers, engineers, and test pilots who struggled against the odds to get the first shuttle into space.

In Higginbotham's deft hands, the human element—sometimes heroic, sometimes cloaked in doublespeak and bluster—shines through the many technical aspects of this story, a constant reminder that every decision was made by people weighing risks versus expediency, their minds distorted by power, money, politics, and yes-men.

Drawing on her own medical experiences and a decade of interviews with doctors, patients, researchers, and public health experts, O'Rourke traces how Western definitions of illness have led us to ignore hard-to-understand conditions that resist easy description or simple cures. The populations most likely to be neglected include women, the working class, and people of color.

9780618839339,The Last Train to Zona Verde,My Ultimate African Safari,"Paul Theroux embarks on what he declares will be his final African journey, traveling from Cape Town through Namibia to Angola's remote corners. This isn't the romantic Africa of safari brochures, but a continent grappling with the legacy of colonialism, crushing poverty, and uncertain futures.

With his characteristic blend of curiosity and curmudgeonry, Theroux encounters everyone from fellow travelers to local guides, from aid workers to ordinary people trying to survive. He reflects honestly on his own privilege as a Western observer while documenting the raw realities he witnesses. The journey becomes both an external exploration of southern Africa's landscapes and communities, and an internal reckoning with what it means to be a lifelong traveler confronting mortality.

Theroux's prose captures both the beauty and brutality of the places he visits, offering no easy answers about Africa's challenges or his own complicated relationship with the continent. This is travel writing at its most unflinching—gorgeous, uncomfortable, and deeply human.","Theroux's final African odyssey takes him from Cape Town to Angola's remote reaches.

As those borders harden, the need for smugglers—or coyotes, or guides—increases every year. Yet the real lives of smugglers are only reported from a distance, using tired stereotypes that depict them as violent warlords.

To understand this essential yet extralegal billion-dollar global industry, internationally recognized anthropologist Jason De León embedded with smugglers moving migrants across Mexico over seven years. The result is unprecedented access to a hidden world.

SOLDIERS AND KINGS offers the first in-depth, character-driven look at human smuggling. This heart-wrenching narrative revolves around one coyote who falls in love and tries to leave smuggling behind. De León chronicles the lives of low-level foot soldiers breaking into the game and morally conflicted gang leaders who oversee ragtag crews along the migrant trail.

A one-sided correspondence with Chancellor Angela Merkel to warn her of the impending doom.

Meanwhile, Florian works for the Boss, head of a local neo-Nazi gang in the small eastern German town of Kana, who has given him work as a graffiti cleaner and a one-room apartment. The Boss is a Bach fanatic and amateur orchestra director, enraged by a graffiti artist defacing monuments to Johann Sebastian Bach throughout Thuringia with wolf emblems. Determined to catch the culprit, he enlists his gang—including Florian—in the chase.

Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding parenthood, illness, and growing old, weaving together fragments of her childhood and married life with John Gregory Dunne and daughter Quintana Roo.

Blue Nights opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana's wedding in New York seven years before. This triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana's childhood—in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter and her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might: How did she fail? What cues did she miss? ""How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?""

Seamlessly woven throughout are incidents that underscore Didion's own aging, something she finds difficult to acknowledge.

Joyride is a magic carpet ride through Orlean's life and career, where every day offers discovery and every moment holds potential for wonder.

Throughout her storied career, curiosity draws her to explore the most ordinary and extraordinary places—from getting inside the head of a regular ten-year-old boy for her legendary profile ""The American Man Age Ten"" to reporting on a woman who owns twenty-seven tigers, from capturing the routine magic of Saturday night to climbing Mt.

Orlean's account offers invaluable insights for writers and an essential guide to embracing any creative path. She reveals her process of dreaming up ideas, managing deadlines, connecting with sources, confronting writer's block, and crafting the perfect lede.

While Orlean has always written her way into other people's lives, Joyride is her most personal book—a searching journey through finding her feet as a journalist, recovering from her first marriage's collapse, falling in love again, becoming a mother while mourning her own mother's decline, and confronting mortality.

In daily life, it is evoked in countless ways—blue skies and blue water offer hope for that which lies beyond current conditions, while blue also carries deep melancholy and heartache, echoing Louis Armstrong's question, ""What did I do to be so Black and blue?""

Celebrated author Imani Perry uses the world's favorite color as a springboard for a riveting emotional, cultural, and spiritual journey that transcends politics or ideology. She traces both blue and Blackness from their earliest roots to contemporary culture, drawing from her own life as well as art and history: the dyed indigo cloths of West Africa traded for human life in the 16th century, the mixture of awe and aversion in characterizations of dark-skinned people as ""Blue Black,"" the fundamentally American art form of blues music sitting at the crossroads of pain and pleasure, and the blue flowers Perry plants to honor a loved one gone too soon.

Their eldest child, Clem, is coming home from college on fire with moral absolutism, having taken an action that will shatter his father. Clem's sister, Becky, long the social queen of her high-school class, has sharply veered into the counterculture, while their brilliant younger brother Perry, who's been selling drugs to seventh graders, has resolved to be a better person. Each of the Hildebrandts seeks a freedom that each of the others threatens to complicate.

Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II’s African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel’s desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war material. Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war, but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS’s remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in the Africa and then on the Continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow.

Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy.

Written with tremendous sweep and power, Homegoing traces the generations that follow across two continents and three hundred years of history.

Effia and Esi are born into different villages. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to her, Esi is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade and shipped to America.

One thread follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other follows Esi's lineage into America—from Southern plantations to the Civil War and Great Migration, from Alabama coal mines to Harlem's jazz clubs and dope houses, right up to the present day.

9780812988840,I Can't Breathe,A Killing on Bay Street,"On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner was killed by police officer Daniel Panteleo on Bay Street in Staten Island, New York. The final moments of Garner's life—and his final words, ""I can't breathe,"" repeated eleven times—were captured in a disturbing video seen by millions. In an era of contested police killings of African Americans, this case seemed the clearest cut of all—yet the officer was never indicted.

The story behind this fateful encounter runs much deeper than those few minutes of video could capture. Garner was a larger-than-life figure, both comic and tragic—a father and son, husband and dreamer, black market entrepreneur and neighborhood fixture—whose rocky journey through life eventually narrowed to a single point: a Staten Island corner where he sold loose cigarettes.

The police department he encountered had its own troubled history—bad policy, perverse incentives, and an uncertain mission, all shadowed by racial control's dominant role in American policing. Taibbi masterfully weaves together Garner's vivid, moving story with the dramatic aftermath of his killing, bringing readers to an urgent question: what job have we given our police, and who suffers when they do it?","Taibbi weaves together the vivid life of Eric Garner with the broken system that killed him.

She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, ""Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn't tint hers?""

The characters span generations and experiences: Amma, a newly acclaimed playwright exploring her Black lesbian identity; Shirley, a teacher worn down by years in underfunded London schools; Carole, Shirley's former student turned successful investment banker; and Carole's mother Bummi, a cleaner worried about her daughter's disconnection from her roots.

From a nonbinary social media influencer to a 93-year-old woman on a Northern England farm, these unforgettable women intersect across lines of age, sexuality, and class. Their stories paint a vivid portrait of contemporary Britain while examining the lasting impact of colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean.

Evaristo centers voices often marginalized, creating a polyphonic celebration of what connects us even when forces try to drive us apart.","Twelve Black British women's lives intersect across generations in this Booker Prize-winning novel.

His stick-figure drawings about science, technology, language, and love have earned a passionate following—and generated some wonderfully strange questions. What if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last?

In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, complemented by signature xkcd comics. They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion.

Channeling the gonzo energy of Hunter S. Thompson and the sharp insight of Joan Didion, Sullivan brings his own laid-back, erudite Southern charm to show us how we really live now.

From his native Kentucky, Sullivan introduces us to Constantine Rafinesque, a nineteenth-century polymath who concocted a fantastical prehistory of the New World. In modern times, he ventures to a Christian rock festival in the Ozarks, meets MTV's Real World alumni who've created their own economy of minor celebrity in Florida, and follows the trail of the blues across the South. He investigates the formative years of Michael Jackson and Axl Rose in Indiana, then travels to the Gulf Coast in Katrina's wake—and returns as residents confront the BP oil spill.

Gradually, a unifying narrative emerges about America that we've never heard told this way. It's a fun-house mirror tour that reveals who we are in ways we never imagined. We don't know whether to laugh or cry at this reflection—and those inevitable sob-guffaws attest to Sullivan's remarkable power.","Sullivan dissects American pop culture with hilarious precision and hang-dog charm.

Moving through her mother's history in the deeply segregated South and her own girlhood as a ""child of miscegenation"" in Mississippi, Trethewey plumbs her sense of dislocation and displacement leading up to the harrowing crime on Memorial Drive in Atlanta in 1985.

With careful persistence, Pete slowly earns fragile trust from both father and son. But when his own estranged thirteen-year-old daughter vanishes, Pete confronts a devastating irony: the man dedicated to saving other people's children has catastrophically failed his own.

As Jeremiah's activities draw FBI attention, Pete finds himself caught in the crossfire of a massive manhunt that will leave no one unscathed.

For centuries, medicine has improvised with whatever's available: sculpting noses from brass, borrowing skin from frogs, crafting eye parts from jet canopies and breasts from petroleum by-products. Today we're attempting to grow body parts from scratch using stem cells and 3D printers.

In Replaceable You, Mary Roach explores the remarkable advances and difficult questions prompted by our bodies' inevitable failings. When does a person decide they'd be better off with a prosthetic than their existing limb? Can a donated heart be made to beat forever? Can an intestine substitute for a vagina?

Roach dives in with characteristic verve and infectious wit. Her travels take her to a legendary Boston burn unit, a ""superclean"" xeno-pigsty in China, and a stem cell ""hair nursery"" in San Diego's tech hub.

9780385535373,In the Kingdom of Ice,The Grand and Terrible Polar Voyage of the USS Jeannette,"In the late nineteenth century, one of the last unmapped areas of the globe obsessed explorers and dreamers alike: the North Pole. No one knew what lay beyond the fortress of ice rimming the northern oceans, though theories abounded. The world's foremost cartographer, German August Petermann, believed warm currents sustained a verdant island at the top of the world.

James Gordon Bennett, the eccentric and stupendously wealthy owner of The New York Herald, had recently captured global attention by dispatching Stanley to find Dr. Livingstone in Africa. Now he was keen to recreate that sensation on an even grander scale. He funded an official U.S. naval expedition to reach the Pole, choosing as captain young officer George Washington De Long, who had gained fame for a daring rescue off Greenland's coast.

On July 8, 1879, the USS Jeannette set sail from San Francisco with 32 men aboard, carrying the aspirations of a young country burning to become a world power. The ship sailed into uncharted seas but was soon trapped in pack ice. Two years into the harrowing voyage, the hull was breached and the crew abandoned ship. The Jeannette sank within an hour, leaving the men marooned a thousand miles north of Siberia with minimal supplies.

Thus began their desperate march across endless ice—a frozen hell in the world's most lonesome corner, battling madness, starvation, and the unforgiving Arctic in their fight for survival.","The true story of the USS Jeannette's doomed 1879 Arctic expedition, when 32 men became trapped in ice and fought for survival across a thousand miles of frozen wasteland.

""America's own brush with epic polar tragedy, the subject of Hampton Sides' phenomenally gripping new book, is a less well-known affair…What ensued — a struggle to survive and a nearly 1,000-mile trek across the Arctic Ocean and into the vastness of Siberia — stands as one of the most perilous journeys ever.

But there is also beauty here… [Sides] writes superbly on the geography of Siberia and the Arctic, and the abundant bird and animal life the explorers encountered on their travels, which took them across ice, storm-tossed seas, treacherous tundra, rocky seacoasts, and volcanic islands.""

Then he met Kate and her daughter Ruby, who offered something he'd never known: order, stability, love. But Paul is a man of deep convictions, and the compromises most people make to get along in the world elude him.

9780593653982,Memorial Days,A Memoir,"Many cultural and religious traditions expect those who are grieving to step away from the world. In contemporary life, we are more often met with red tape and to-do lists. This is exactly what happened to Geraldine Brooks when her partner of more than three decades, Tony Horwitz—just sixty years old and seemingly healthy—collapsed and died on a Washington, D.C. sidewalk.

After spending their early years together as foreign correspondents in conflict zones, Geraldine and Tony had settled into a rich life on Martha's Vineyard, raising two boys. Their days were filled with meaningful work, good humor, and tenderness—writing during the day, cooking family dinners in the evening, watching sunsets at the beach with friends. All of this ended abruptly on Memorial Day 2019 with the phone call we all dread.

The demands were immediate and relentless. Without space to grieve, the sudden loss became a yawning gulf. Three years later, Brooks booked a flight to a remote island off the coast of Australia, finally giving herself time to mourn. In a shack on the pristine, rugged coast, she often went days without seeing another person, pondering how different cultures grieve and what rituals might help rebuild a life around the void of Tony's death.

A spare and profoundly moving memoir, Memorial Days captures both a larger-than-life man and a timeless love, exquisitely revealing the joy, agony, and mystery of life.","Brooks retreats to a remote Australian island three years after her husband's sudden death, seeking the space to grieve that modern life denied her.

9780062005595,Kansas City Lightning,The Rise and Times of Charlie Parker,"Charlie ""Yardbird"" Parker lived one of the most dramatic and tragic lives in American music. From his breakthrough as a Kansas City prodigy in the late 1930s to his death in 1955 at just thirty-five, Parker revolutionized jazz with the creation of bebop, even as drug addiction shadowed his career and cut it short.

Since then, Parker has become legend—immortalized in bootlegs and reissues, in the graffiti ""Bird Lives!"", in annual festivals and daily radio tributes, and on screen in Clint Eastwood's Bird. Yet his full story has rarely been told.

In this first volume of a projected two-part biography, Stanley Crouch draws on decades of research and interviews to uncover the real Parker: the gifted teenager shaped by Depression-era Kansas City, the apprentice absorbing lessons from Lester Young and Count Basie, and the young man torn between music, drugs, his domineering mother, and his teenage bride.

A community known for its Little League World Series champions instead made headlines for a different reason: a cluster of childhood cancers scientifically linked to local pollution.

For years, chemical companies had used Toms River as their private dumping ground, burying tens of thousands of leaky drums and discharging billions of gallons of contaminated wastewater into the town's river.

Robert's father was in jail, his mother earned less than $15,000 a year, but his intellect earned him a spot studying molecular biochemistry and biophysics at one of America's most elite universities.

Yet Yale didn't make life easier. Robert carried the weight of his dual existence—navigating the ivy-covered campus while remaining connected to home, where he dealt drugs to support his family.

Through Robert's relationships with his struggling mother, incarcerated father, teachers, friends, and fellow dealers, this biography explores America's most enduring conflicts: race, class, drugs, education, and family. It's about the collision between two insular worlds and the near-impossible challenge of moving between them.

This is a story about poverty, single motherhood, and finding role models in communities where men are more likely to go to prison than college. About reaching your potential while taking responsibility for family, no matter the cost. Most of all, it's about one singular young man whose violent end is heartbreaking and unforgettable.","Jeff Hobbs chronicles his Yale roommate Robert Peace, a brilliant young man from Newark who navigated between two worlds—elite academia and the dangerous streets of home.

The key to this mysterious woman's identity lies in Adanson's unpublished memoir, concealed in a secret compartment. Within its pages unfolds a story as fantastical as it is tragic: Maram is the fabled revenant, a young woman of noble birth from the kingdom of Waalo who was sold into slavery but escaped from the Island of Gorée—a major embarkation point of the transatlantic slave trade—to a hidden village in the forest.

While on a research expedition in West Africa as a young man, Adanson heard the story of the revenant and became obsessed with finding her. Accompanied by his guide, he ventured deep into the Senegalese bush on a journey that revealed not only the savagery of French colonial occupation but also the unlikely transports of the human heart.

Her father headed pediatrics at the nation's oldest Black hospital; her mother moved in socialite circles. Since the nineteenth century, this colored aristocracy has stood apart, measuring itself against both white society and the broader Black community while maintaining careful distance from both.

Jefferson reckons with the psychological contradictions of this rarefied world at pivotal moments—the civil rights era, the dawn of feminism, the illusion of post-racial America. She charts how these cultural pressures shaped a life caught between worlds, exploring the strictures and demands of her upbringing with unflinching honesty.

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it's said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene.

9780865479845,Soul Mining,A Musical Life,"Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, U2, Peter Gabriel, and the Neville Brothers all have something in common: some of their best albums were produced by Daniel Lanois. A French-speaking kid from Canada, Lanois was driven by his innate curiosity and intense love of music to transcend his small-town origins and become one of the world's most prolific and successful record producers, as well as a brilliant musician in his own right.

Lanois takes us through his childhood—from being one of four kids raised by a single mother on a hairdresser's salary, to his discovery by Brian Eno, to his work on albums such as U2's The Joshua Tree, Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind, and Emmylou Harris's Wrecking Ball. Revealing for the first time his unique recording secrets and innovations, Lanois delves into the ongoing evolution of technology, from his earliest sonic experiments with reel-to-reel decks to the arrival of the download era.

Part technological treatise, part philosophical manifesto on the nature of artistic excellence, Soul Mining brings readers viscerally inside the recording studio. Beyond skill, beyond record budgets, beyond image and ego, Lanois's work shows the value of dedication and soul in his lifelong quest to find the perfect mixture of tradition and innovation.",The legendary producer behind U2's The Joshua Tree and Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind shares his unconventional journey from small-town Canada to music's upper echelon.,240,,Music / History & Criticism,Faber & Faber,09/11/2010,Daniel Lanois,"Daniel Lanois is one of the most respected producers in the music industry, having won eight Grammy Awards for his work with artists like U2, Bob Dylan, and Emmylou Harris.

""The master musician and producer offers a typically idiosyncratic take on his life and art . . . Readers will savor the unique character of the producer's unconventional technique, which often employs setting up a jerry-rigged studio with vintage gear in an exotic locale. . . Lanois' book bursts with atmosphere and feeling. He is that rare breed, a lyrical technocrat, and he emerges from the work as one of music's most unusual and charismatic figures. There's really nothing like this oft-rapturous work in the canon of musical memoirs.""

—Kirkus

""In his humble, self-effacing memoir of growing up poor in Canada, Lanois, born in a small Quebec town, describes the difficulties he faced . . . He discusses specific albums, including U2's The Joshua Tree and the Unforgettable Fire, Dylan's Oh Mercy and Time Out of Mind, and Harris's Wrecking Ball.

In this spellbinding memoir, Norman connects these experiences to show how life tangles with the psyche to become literature.

His story begins with a Midwest boyhood summer working in a bookmobile, shadowed by a grifter father and shaped by the erotic tutelage of his brother's girlfriend—a portrait both harrowing and hilarious. From there, his journey takes him to the Arctic, where he spends part of a decade translating Inuit tales, including the story of a soapstone carver transformed into a goose whose migration lament is ""I hate to leave this beautiful place."" It's there he hears over the radio that ""John Lennon was murdered tonight in the city of New York.""

These survivors aren't the legendary heroes like Lancelot or Gawain. They're the Round Table's misfits: Sir Palomides, the Saracen Knight; Sir Dagonet, Arthur's fool who was knighted as a joke; and Nimue, Merlin's former apprentice who turned against her master and buried him under a hill.

Now this unlikely fellowship must rebuild Camelot in a world thrown off balance. God has abandoned Britain, and the old gods are returning, led by Morgan le Fay. To restore order, they must reclaim Excalibur and solve the mystery of why the brilliant, lonely King Arthur fell.

Steeped in Arthurian tradition yet thoroughly modern, The Bright Sword delivers classic elements—duels and quests, magic swords and Fisher Kings—while exploring what happens when broken people try to heal a broken land. It's an epic about imperfect heroes discovering that sometimes the aftermath of legend is where the real story begins.","After King Arthur's death, his surviving misfits—outcasts, fools, and former enemies—must rebuild Camelot from the ruins.

9780525562207,Get the Picture,A Mind-Bending Journey among the Inspired Artists and Obsessive Art Fiends Who Taught Me How to See,"Award-winning journalist Bianca Bosker's life was upended when she wandered into the art world—and couldn't look away. Intrigued by artists who hyperventilate around their favorite colors and art fiends who max out credit cards for hunks of metal they think can change the world, Bosker grew fixated on understanding why art matters and how any of us could engage with it more deeply.

In Get the Picture, Bosker throws herself into the nerve center of art and the people who live for it: gallerists, collectors, curators, and artists themselves—the kind who work multiple jobs to afford their studios while scrambling to get eyes on their work. She stretches canvases until her fingers blister, talks her way into A-list parties full of billionaire collectors, has her face sat on by a nearly-naked performance artist, and forces herself to stare at a single sculpture for hours while working as a museum security guard.

Probing everything from cave paintings to Instagram, and from the science of sight to the importance of beauty, Get the Picture examines art's role in our culture, economy, and hearts. It's a rollicking adventure that will change the way you see forever.","The Cork Dork author infiltrates New York's exclusive art world with her signature immersive journalism.

Get the Picture is one of the funniest books I've read about New York's contemporary art scene . . . Brilliant.""

""This book freaked me out. Bosker's accessible, conversational spelunking into the world of contemporary art so powerfully rehydrated the PTSD in me between the little kid artist I once was with the self-consciously constricted thinker I became in art school that at one point I simply had to put it down, shaken. If you've ever wondered 'what happened' to art—galleries, critics, collectors—and, of course, artists—then this book is a very companionable start. It's also very funny, to say nothing of very vivid. And, confoundingly, very, very difficult to put down.""

Born just fifteen months apart, Subhash and Udayan Mitra are inseparable brothers in 1960s Calcutta, often mistaken for each other yet destined for vastly different futures. Udayan—charismatic and impulsive—throws himself into the Naxalite movement, a violent rebellion against poverty and inequity. Subhash, the dutiful son, leaves for America to pursue scientific research in quiet coastal isolation.

When Subhash learns what happened to his brother in the lowland outside their family home, he returns to India hoping to heal the wounds Udayan left behind—including those carved into his brother's wife's heart.

Masterfully suspenseful and piercingly intimate, The Lowland is both an engrossing family saga and a story steeped in history. Lahiri delivers a work of stunning beauty and complex emotion that spans generations and continents with seamless authenticity.","Two brothers in 1960s Calcutta are bound by love but torn apart when one joins a violent political rebellion.

The story of two brothers in India who are exceptionally close to each other, and yet completely different, the novel spans more than four decades in the life of [their] family, shaped and shaken by the events that have brought them together and tear them apart. . . . Lahiri has earned renown for her short stories, [yet] this masterful novel deserves to attract an even wider readership.""

—Kirkus

""Lahiri's work resists pithy quotation, and until now, has avoided fireworks. But [her] first sentence works like a slow fuse. Divided consciousness has been her recurrent theme, [which] the transplanted Indian families in her earlier work know well. This time, she daringly redraws the map—[as] one of two close-knit brothers becomes a revolutionary while the other proceeds to the U.S. Loyalties are tested, twisted to extremes that become clear only toward the end. Here worlds, new and old, contain terrors.""

—Ann Hulbert

""Lahiri tracks, with patience and tenacity, the emotional and geographical distances that time opens up between people, the things that get lost in those spaces, and the rare and surprising things that endure. In The Lowland, we are all emigrants, not from one country to another but from the present to the future. Lahiri's prose style is legendarily smooth, unshowy, unvarying . . . The Lowland gains tremendous power as it goes on. Language takes on the role of time itself. The Lowland feels less like a story being told than a tide slowly going out, gradually, inevitably revealing the shape of what was there all along.""

Lalami asks profound questions about privacy, freedom, and whether even the most invasive surveillance can truly capture who we are.","Dreams become evidence in Lalami's chilling near-future thriller.

9780525561729,Mark Twain,,"Before he was Mark Twain, he was Samuel Langhorne Clemens—a Missouri boy who dreamed of piloting steamboats on the Mississippi. When the Civil War interrupted his river career, young Clemens headed west to Nevada Territory and landed a newspaper job, writing dispatches that attracted attention for their brashness and humor. It wasn't long before this former steamboat pilot was recognized nationwide for his literary brilliance, writing under a pen name he would immortalize.

In this richly nuanced portrait, acclaimed biographer Ron Chernow brings his considerable powers to bear on a man who shamelessly sought fame and fortune while crafting his persona with meticulous care. After establishing himself as journalist, satirist, and lecturer, Twain settled in Hartford with his wife and three daughters, where he wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He threw himself into American culture and emerged as the nation's most notable political pundit.

Yet his madcap business ventures eventually bankrupted him, forcing the family into nine years of European exile. He endured the deaths of his wife and two daughters, and his final years were marked by heartache, political crusades, and eccentric behavior that sometimes obscured darker forces at play. Drawing on thousands of letters and hundreds of unpublished manuscripts, Chernow masterfully captures the man whose career reflected America's westward expansion and industrialization—the most important white author of his generation to grapple fully with slavery's legacy.","Ron Chernow's monumental biography captures the magnificent and often maddening life of Samuel Clemens, the Missouri dreamer who became Mark Twain.

To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, costly courtesans, earthquakes, and typhoons comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout and resourceful young clerk. He has five years in the East to earn a fortune large enough to win the hand of his wealthy fiancée back in Holland.

But Jacob's plans shift after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor and midwife to the city's powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully broken.

9780593701843,Raising Hare,A Memoir,"In February 2021, political advisor Chloe Dalton stumbles upon a newborn hare—a leveret—that had been chased by a dog. Fearing for its life, she brings it home, only to discover how impossible it is to rear a wild hare, most of whom perish in captivity from shock or starvation.

Through trial and error, she learns to feed and care for the leveret with every intention of returning it to the wilderness. Instead, it becomes her constant companion, wandering the fields and woods at night and returning to Dalton's house by day. Though she fears the hare will be preyed upon by foxes, stoats, feral cats, and raptors, she never restricts it to the house. Each time the hare leaves, Chloe knows she may never see it again—yet she understands that to confine it would be its own kind of death.

Raising Hare chronicles their extraordinary relationship while diving deep into the lives and nature of hares, and how they've been viewed throughout history in art, literature, and folklore. A reminder that the most beautiful experiences arise when we least expect them.","During lockdown in the English countryside, a political advisor rescues an abandoned leveret and forms an unlikely bond.

Traumatized by reeducation at the hands of his former best friend Man, the Sympathizer struggles to assimilate into French culture while finding Paris both seductive and disturbing. Through dinner parties hosted by his French Vietnamese ""aunt,"" he falls in with left-wing intellectuals who provide stimulation for his mind—and customers for his merchandise.

But his new life brings unforeseen perils: the self-torture of addiction, the authoritarianism of a colonial state, and the seemingly impossible task of reuniting his two closest friends whose opposing worldviews put them in direct conflict. The Sympathizer will need all his wits, resourcefulness, and moral flexibility to survive.

""In a decade whose fiction is dominated by autofiction, there's something de´mode´ about Nguyen's novels, which I think can fairly be considered a single artistic endeavor . . . The Sympathizer and The Committed are, to borrow James Wood's phrase for such novels, perpetual-motion machines, their exuberance perhaps a suitable method given how vast a subject he aims to tackle. The breathless voice and sprawling plots of these novels made me think of Midnight's Children: manic language and impossible story suit the strange truth of colonialism. Nguyen does Salman Rushdie one better by deploying the conventions of genre fiction; he gently seduces the reader into two rambling, discursive works passionately interested in war and violence, race and identity, colonialism and history.""

""The Committed is nothing short of revelatory. As it haunts, bifurcates, and envelops us in its illumination of all that we have failed to notice about the far reaches of colonization, we are also thrilled by its many turns and charms. This book is fierce, and unrelentingly good. Hilarious and subversive, philosophical and hallucinatory, it is much more than a sequel, more like a necessary appendage in a brilliant and expansive anti-colonial body of work, from the twisted and playful mind of the one and only Viet Thanh Nguyen.

9781668045237,Claire McCardell,The Designer Who Set Women Free,"Claire McCardell forever changed fashion—and most importantly, the lives of women. She shattered cultural norms around women's clothes, and today much of what we wear traces back to her ingenious, rebellious mind.

McCardell invented ballet flats and mix-and-match separates, introducing wrap dresses, hoodies, leggings, and denim into womenswear. She tossed out corsets in favor of comfortable elegance and insisted on pockets, even as male designers didn't see a need for them. She made zippers easy to reach because a woman ""may live alone and like it,"" McCardell once wrote, ""but you may regret it if you wrench your arm trying to zip a back zipper into place.""

After World War II, McCardell fought the severe, hyper-feminized silhouette championed by male designers like Christian Dior. Dior claimed he wanted to ""save women from nature."" McCardell, by contrast, wanted to set women free. She became, as young journalist Betty Friedan called her in 1955, ""The Gal Who Defied Dior.""

Filled with personal drama and industry secrets, this story reveals how McCardell built an empire when women rarely reached business's upper echelons.

Her aunt is an enigma—an outlier in their working-class family whose magnificent home and handsome foreign husband, the president of a soft drink company, are symbols of her elevated status.

The seventeen-room mansion is filled with German-made furnishings, sprawling gardens, and even an old zoo where the family's pygmy hippopotamus resides.

It's midsummer in Wyoming and Alexandra is barely holding on. She's grieving her father, pining for her home country of Zimbabwe, reeling from a midlife breakup, newly sober, and navigating an uncertain relationship with a younger woman. She's determined to find her footing again.

Then the unthinkable happens: her 21-year-old son Fi dies suddenly in his sleep.

No stranger to loss—young siblings, a parent, a homeland—Alexandra is nonetheless shattered. But she knows she cannot abandon her two surviving daughters as her own mother had done. From a sheep wagon in the Wyoming mountains to a grief sanctuary in New Mexico to a silent meditation retreat in Alberta, Alexandra travels the spine of the Rockies searching for how to grieve herself whole.

There are no easy answers, only the wild medicine of poetry, ritual, nature, and the indigenous wisdom she absorbed as a child in Zimbabwe. By turns disarming, devastating, and unexpectedly funny, this memoir chronicles the painstaking work of grieving a child in a culture that offers no roadmap.","A devastating memoir about losing a child, told with the unflinching honesty and unexpected humor that made Fuller's previous work essential reading.

Strange creatures wash up on the riverbank, portentous ravens gather on roofs of people about to die. But when villagers start hearing barking—and one claims to see the Mansfield sisters transform before his very eyes—the allegations spark fascination and fear like nothing before.

The truth is that though the inhabitants of Little Nettlebed have never much liked the Mansfield girls, they've always had plenty to say about them. A little odd, think some; a little high on themselves, perhaps. As the rotating perspectives of five villagers make clear, now is no exception.

Even if local belief in witchcraft is waning, an aversion to difference is as widespread as ever. These conflicting narratives all point to the same ultimate conclusion: Something isn't right in Little Nettlebed, and the sisters will be the ones to pay for it.

9780593656297,Girl on Girl,How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves,"What happened to feminism in the twenty-first century? This question feels increasingly urgent in a moment of cultural and legislative backlash, when widespread uncertainty about the movement's power and focus threatens decades of progress.

Sophie Gilbert identifies an inflection point in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the energy of third-wave and riot grrrl feminism collapsed into a regressive period of hyper-objectification and infantilization. Mining the darker side of nostalgia, Gilbert trains her keen analytic eye on the most revealing cultural objects of the era—music, film, television, fashion, tabloid journalism, and more.

What she recounts is harrowing: the leering gaze of the paparazzi, the gleeful cruelty of early reality TV, and a burgeoning internet culture vicious toward women in the spotlight. Gilbert tracks many of the period's dominant themes back to the rise of internet porn, which gained widespread influence as it pervaded our collective consciousness.

The result is a devastating portrait of a time when American excess, materialism, and power worship collided with reactionary, puritanical currents. Amid a collective reconsideration of how women are treated in public, Girl on Girl is a blistering indictment of the matrix of misogyny that shaped early twenty-first century culture—and continues to shape our world today.","Atlantic critic Sophie Gilbert excavates the cultural wreckage of the early 2000s, when third-wave feminism collapsed into hyper-objectification and cruelty.

If you're confused about the current uncertainty about feminism's power, Sophie Gilbert has done the work of painstakingly and granularly tracing every cultural thread to reveal how we got here. Gilbert unmasks an insidious cultural coup that seemingly overnight dethroned the transgressive women of the 90s; 'Just like that they were gone–replaced by girls,' she writes. Over and over, Gilbert reminds us: it wasn't always this bad–in fact, it was getting better, then it got taken away. Girl on Girl is a necessary corrective of cultural memory, but more importantly, it is a definitive archive of that disempowerment and its ensuing cruelties.""

""Searing . . . There were several passages in Gilbert's blistering, sobering book Girl on Girl that challenged my selective nostalgia, making me wince.

Her book is a course correction of sorts, taking a holistic tack to explain our current sociopolitical reality: one in which women's hard-fought gains are quickly eroding, and men and boys are in crisis . . . Across 10 rigorously researched but never stuffy chapters, Gilbert has compiled perhaps the first comprehensive examination of turn-of-the-millennium mainstream, cool-kid trends and ephemera, and how they were largely molded by those in power to sell a generation of girls and young women reality-warping lies . . . Gilbert isn't concerned with softening the blow. Instead, she's intent on snapping millennials out of any instinct to idealize the decades that shaped us—even if that awareness stings.""

9780307273598,Inferno,"The World at War, 1939-1945","World War II involved tens of millions of soldiers and cost sixty million lives—an average of twenty-seven thousand a day. For thirty-five years, Max Hastings has researched and written about different aspects of the war. Now, for the first time, he gives us a magnificent, single-volume history of the entire conflict.

Through strikingly detailed stories of everyday people—soldiers, sailors and airmen; British housewives and Indian peasants; SS killers and the citizens of Leningrad, some of whom resorted to cannibalism during the two-year siege; Japanese suicide pilots and American carrier crews—Hastings provides an intimate portrait of the world at war.

He traces major developments like Hitler's refusal to retreat from the Soviet Union until it was too late, Stalin's ruthless use of superior population to wear down the German army, Churchill's leadership during the dark days of 1940-41, and Roosevelt's steady hand before and after America entered the war. But he also illuminates darker, less explored regions: the conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland, where the Finns fiercely resisted Stalin's invading Red Army, and the Bengal famine of 1943-44, when at least one million people died in what Nehru called ""the final epitaph of British rule"" in India.

Remarkably informed and wide-ranging, Inferno offers a new and essential understanding of one of the greatest and bloodiest events of the twentieth century.","Hastings delivers a sweeping yet intimate portrait of World War II, weaving together major political developments with the deeply human stories of ordinary people caught in history's most devastating conflict.",729,,History / Wars & Conflicts / World War II,Knopf,01/11/2011,Max Hastings,"Max Hastings is the author of more than thirty books, including Inferno and The Secret War.

He lives in West Berkshire, England.","""A new, original, necessary history, in many ways the crowning of a life's work. A professional war correspondent who has personally witnessed armed conflict in Vietnam, the Falkland Islands and other danger zones, Hastings has a sober, unromantic and realistic view of battle that puts him into a different category from the armchair generals whose gung-ho, schoolboy attitude to war fills the pages of a great majority of military histories. He writes with grace, fluency and authority…Inferno is superb.""

—Richard J. Evans, The New York Times

""If there is a contemporary British historian who is the chronicler of World War II, it would be Max Hastings…[Inferno] is a true distillation of everything this historian has learned from a lifetime of scholarship-and more important, of real thought-on what he calls 'the greatest and most terrible event in human history.'""

—Martin Rubin, San Francisco Chronicle

""A relatively brief review can only begin to indicate the depth, breadth, complexity and pervasive humanity of this extraordinary book. The literature of World War II is, as Hastings notes at the beginning of his bibliography, so vast as almost to defy enumeration or comprehension, but ""Inferno"" immediately moves to the head of the list. It is in all ways a monumental achievement.""

As a young man, he pokes at the city's pretensions through American music, bad poetry, and slightly better journalism.

Then comes Chicago: watching helplessly as war engulfs Sarajevo, unable to return home. His parents and sister flee with only the family dog, abandoning everything they'd ever known. Hemon starts over, building a new life and family in an unfamiliar city.

Yet this isn't really a memoir. The Book of My Lives defies convention—it's simultaneously a love song to two cities, a heartbreaking tribute to family bonds, and a stirring call to go play soccer (not for exercise). Built on fierce intelligence and devastating experience, it's driven by passion and sharp insight. Like the best narratives, it will leave you fundamentally changed, seeing the world through new eyes.","Essays spanning Sarajevo and Chicago explore displacement, family, and identity with devastating wit.

This is a book--like all of Aleksandar Hemon's books--that is an aria for our times. I will cherish it.""

—Colum McCann

""Aleksandar Hemon's work crackles with so much humor and irony, so much compassion and humanity, that The Book of My Lives's true calling almost goes by unnoticed: it is, without doubt, the most necessary, intimate, and heartbreaking portrait of a world lost to one of history's darkest conflicts.""

Russell weaves together the stories of five unforgettable characters: a ""Prairie Witch"" whose body serves as a bank vault for people's memories and secrets; a Polish wheat farmer who learns how quickly a hoarded blessing can become a curse; his orphan niece, a basketball star and witch's apprentice in furious flight from her grief; a voluble scarecrow; and a New Deal photographer whose time-traveling camera threatens to reveal both the town's secrets and its fate.

This novel is above all a reckoning with a nation's forgetting—enacting the settler amnesia and willful omissions passed down from generation to generation, and unearthing not only horrors but shimmering possibilities. The Antidote echoes with urgent warnings for our own climate emergency, challenging readers with a vision of what might have been—and what still could be.","Five characters' fates intertwine after a devastating dust storm hits Depression-era Nebraska.

""In The Antidote, Karen Russell writes indelible characters who keep choosing messy community over silo'd righteousness, motion over despair. She presents for inspection America's most persistent chorus of moral self-defense, ""Better them than us,"" and shows how it rots the minds, hearts, and land of all who sing it. Only Karen Russell could write a dust bowl opus with such raucous brio—The Antidote soars with exigent joy and laugh-out-loud scenes, with memory witches and enchanted cameras and the world's most lovable sentient scarecrow. It's magic, a book doing this big work and also making it propulsive, eminently readable. If irony bypasses the difficulty of describing things, then the vivid sincerity on display here marks a virtuosic artist at the height of her lucidity. Russell has rendered with soul and urgency the vast inexpressible ache at the heart of American gratitude.""

—Kaveh Akbar, author of Martyr!

""This novel swept me up and carried me away, even while somehow burying me, and digging up something about the story of this country I didn't know I needed to know. As with all of Russell's work, heaviness and levity are always kept in balance, and so I was lifted even while being devastated by the book's many brutal truths and stark beauty. I'd already considered Russell's vivid and inventive imagination to be endless, but here exploring a history of Nebraska we get an unearthing of this country's still relatively untold origin story, the part about its original people, and the cost paid in order that this country might be formed. Finishing the book I felt completely covered in the forgotten dust of what too few look back on, with rare clarity, not to mention the intricate braid of narratives masterfully woven here. The Antidote is one, for an all too poisoned American narrative about land and family and belonging.""

This heart-lifting chronicle explores why they did it, what their contemporaries thought of them, and how their flights revealed our planet's secrets.

Holmes brings to life the early Anglo-French balloon rivalries, the firework flights of the beautiful Sophie Blanchard, and the long-distance voyages of American entrepreneur John Wise and French photographer Felix Nadar. He documents balloons used to observe Civil War battles (including a flight by George Armstrong Custer) and the legendary sixty-seven manned balloons that escaped from Paris during the Prussian siege of 1870-71—the first successful civilian airlift in history.

The book captures James Glaisher's high-altitude exploits seven miles above earth without oxygen, helping establish meteorology as a science, and explores how Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne felt flight's imaginative impact. A seamless fusion of history, art, science, and biography, Falling Upwards offers a masterly portrait of human endeavor, recklessness, and vision.","The daring pioneers who first took to the skies in balloons come alive in this captivating cultural history.

Holmes lovingly charts a course from the Montgolfier brothers' first hydrogen-fuelled flights in the 1780s to the use of balloons by fugitive East Germans in the 1970s and the latest forays by polar explorer David Hempleman-Adams, a history full of awe and inefficiency…Holmes is a truly masterly storyteller.""

In ""The Feminist,"" a young man's passionate allyship turns to furious nihilism as he realizes, over thirty lonely years, that it isn't getting him laid. A young woman's unrequited crush in ""Pics"" spirals into borderline obsession and systematic destruction of her sense of self. In ""Ahegao; or, The Ballad of Sexual Repression,"" a shy late bloomer's flailing efforts at a first relationship lead to a life-upending mistake.

Initially welcomed, these newcomers soon faced horrific racial terror as economic downturns created scapegoats and white resentment grew.

What followed was unprecedented: a series of federal laws aimed at excluding Chinese laborers, marking the first time the United States barred people based on race. Michael Luo follows this community from these brutal early years to modern times, revealing how they persisted despite systematic persecution.

Luo chronicles early victims like Gene Tong, a Los Angeles herbalist lynched by a mob, and demagogues like Denis Kearney, whose sandlot speeches fueled anti-Chinese hatred. He also highlights pioneering activists like Wong Chin Foo, who fought for their community's rights. At the book's heart lies a shameful chapter: the brutal expulsion of Chinese residents from towns across the American West, creating the country's first undocumented immigrants.

Drawing on archives nationwide and written with a New Yorker writer's precision, this revelatory history traces a through-line from 1889—when the Supreme Court labeled Chinese Americans ""strangers in the land""—to today's twenty-two million Asian Americans, many still fighting the same battles for belonging.","Michael Luo chronicles the Chinese American experience from the Gold Rush to today, revealing how a community persevered through exclusion laws, violence, and systematic persecution.

That struggle drives the book's original structure: each chapter uses a different narrative trope—haunted house, erotica, bildungsroman—to examine events from new angles.

She looks back at her religious adolescence, unpacks the stereotype of lesbian relationships as safe and utopian, and widens the view with essayistic explorations of abuse in queer relationships. Machado casts her critical eye over legal proceedings, fairy tales, Star Trek, and Disney villains, as well as iconic works of film and fiction.

His days moving stolen goods are over—until he needs Jackson 5 tickets for his daughter and decides to hit up his old police contact Munson.

9780307265722,1493,Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,"More than 200 million years ago, the continents split apart, evolving in isolation until Columbus's arrival in the Americas ended that separation at a stroke. His voyages unleashed the ""Columbian Exchange""—a vast transfer of plants, animals, and microbes that transformed diets, landscapes, and lives across the planet. Tomatoes reached Italy, chili peppers reached Asia, earthworms and rats spread everywhere.

Decades later, the Spanish established global trade through Manila, linking American silver, Asian silk, and European markets in the first true world economy. In 1493, Charles C. Mann reveals how this worldwide network fostered Europe's rise, convulsed Africa, weakened China, and for two centuries made Mexico City the hub of global interaction.

Drawing on cutting-edge research, Mann shows how the ecological and economic revolutions set in motion by Columbus still reverberate in today's fiercest debates over immigration, trade, and culture.","Following his bestselling 1491, Mann explores the biological collision that reshaped our world. The most momentous ecological event since the dinosaurs—told with startling research and brilliant clarity.",560,,"History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies)",Knopf,09/08/2011,Charles C.

Then the glamorous Shahid family enters her life: Reza, an enchanting student; his father Skandar, a dashing Lebanese professor on fellowship at Harvard; and his mother Sirena, an effortlessly alluring Italian artist. When Reza is attacked by schoolyard bullies, Nora is drawn deep into their complex world, falling in love with them separately and together.

Nora's happiness explodes her boundaries, and she discovers in herself an unprecedented ferocity—one that puts her beliefs and sense of self at stake. Told with urgency and piercing emotion, this brilliant novel explores the intensity, thrill, and devastating cost of embracing an authentic life.","Elementary school teacher Nora Eldridge has settled into life as the reliable woman upstairs until the glamorous Shahid family awakens her buried dreams and desires.

The title names an archetype: the nice, unmarried lady on the third floor who smiles in the lobby and is quickly forgotten. Nora is a caring schoolteacher seemingly content to look after her ailing father, her dreams of living the life of an artist subsumed by the act of simply living a life. Bitterly funny and self-aware, she claims to be having a 'Lucy Jordan moment,' name-checking the Marianne Faithfull song . . . It seems right that Messud's follow-up to The Emperor's Children grasps furiously at life and punches back at encroaching age. In The Woman Upstairs, she abandons the polyphonic narration of the previous novel for first-person carpe diem prose that is leaner and meaner. . . .

""From its opening lines, Messud's new novel grips like a choke hold. . . .The most unlikely hero, Nora, self-identifies with scornful wit and rage as the titular Woman Upstairs. But oh how Messud, whose last novel was the sharp and brilliant The Emperor's Children, gives her woman room to roar. . . . Sirena awakens in her an unapologetic lust of life that Nora was previously too good or too scared to claim. The narrative burns toward an inevitable betrayal of startling proportions, one that instead of diminishing Nora lights her ablaze. This is a book sweating with rage, and an exhilarating one. Read it in an openmouthed gulp. After the final powerful paragraphs, in which Nora howls in galvanized fury, throw it down and have a drink, or a dreamless nap. Don't be surprised if you then pick it back up and start all over again.""

Fifty years have passed since the paper was founded by an enigmatic millionaire. Now, amid stained carpeting and dingy office furniture, the staff's personal dramas overshadow the daily headlines. Kathleen, the imperious editor in chief, nurses wounds from a betrayal in her open marriage. Arthur, the lazy obituary writer, is transformed by personal tragedy.

""Gutting and terrifying. Vivid and exquisite.

This book is sharp, shocking, anxiety-provoking, superb. It is exactly what you want, and need, to read.""

—Julia Phillips, author of Disappearing Earth

""Jessamine Chan captures, in heartbreaking tones, the exacting price women pay in a patriarchal society that despises them, that reduces their worth to their viability for procreation and capacity for mothering. The School for Good Mothers is not so much a warning for some possible dystopian nightmare as much as it is an alarm announcing that the nightmare is here. The book is, thus, a weeping testimony, a haunting song, and a piercing rebuke of both the misogynist social order and the traps it lays for women, girls, and femmes. Good Mothers deserves an honored place next to the works of Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler.""

9781982168438,Cloud Cuckoo Land,,"Among the most celebrated novels of recent times, Cloud Cuckoo Land is a triumph of imagination and compassion—a soaring story about children on the cusp of adulthood in worlds in peril, who find resilience, hope, and a book.

In 15th-century Constantinople, an orphan named Anna learns to read within the city's formidable walls. In this ancient place famous for its libraries, she discovers what might be the last copy of a centuries-old story about Aethon, who longs to be turned into a bird so he can fly to a utopian paradise in the sky. Outside the walls, Omeir, a village boy conscripted with his beloved oxen into the army laying siege to the city, follows a path that will cross with Anna's.

In present-day Idaho, octogenarian Zeno rehearses children in a play adaptation of Aethon's story, preserved against all odds through centuries. Tucked among the library shelves is a bomb, planted by Seymour, a troubled, idealistic teenager. This is another siege.

In the not-so-distant future, aboard the interstellar ship Argos, Konstance sits alone in a vault, copying Aethon's story onto scraps of sacking—the same tale her father once told her.

Anna, Omeir, Seymour, Zeno, and Konstance are dreamers and outsiders whose lives are gloriously intertwined.

A famous author whose novels haven't aged gracefully into the modern era, he remains completely unaware that the play centers around a vacation they took years earlier to an island off Sicily, where he dictated a new book to her.

Sophia's play has garnered rave reviews, but her father has studiously avoided reading any of them. When the house lights dim, however, he understands that his daughter has laid him bare—using the events of their summer to create an incisive, witty, skewering critique of the attitudes and sexual mores of his generation.

Set during one staging of the play, The Hypocrite seamlessly shifts time and perspective, illuminating an argument between father and daughter that examines the fraught inheritances each generation must contend with and the struggle to nurture empathy in a rapidly changing world.","A playwright transforms her novelist father's moral failings into devastating theater.

In the barn they tended to the animals, but also to each other, transforming the hollowed-out shed into a place of human refuge, a source of intimacy and hope in a world ruled by vicious masters. But when an older man—a fellow slave—seeks to gain favor by preaching the master's gospel on the plantation, the enslaved begin to turn on their own. Isaiah and Samuel's love, which was once so simple, is seen as sinful and a clear danger to the plantation's harmony.

With fierce lyricism, Robert Jones, Jr., summons the voices of slaver and enslaved alike—from Isaiah and Samuel to the calculating slave master to the long line of women who have carried the soul of the plantation on their shoulders. As tensions build and the weight of centuries culminates in a climactic reckoning, The Prophets fearlessly reveals the pain and suffering of inheritance while portraying the enormous, heroic power of love.","Two enslaved men find refuge and forbidden love in each other on a Deep South plantation.

It manages to be many things at once, stirring both the heart and the intellect in an exploration of human desire and depravity.

But Circe is a strange child—not powerful like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power: witchcraft that can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.

Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with famous figures from mythology—the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and wily Odysseus.

But there is danger for a woman who stands alone. Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying Olympians. To protect what she loves most, she must summon all her strength and choose whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.

At Placid Hall, a plantation in the American South, Cato and William endure the whims of their tyrannical captor, Cannonball Greene. They face inhumane toil in the quarry by day, beatings by night, and the constant threat of separation from loved ones. It's this cruel practice—the destruction of love, the belief that Black people aren't capable of loving—that cuts deepest.

William, reserved and stubborn, falls for Margaret, a woman with self-possession beyond her years. Cato, still wounded from losing his first love Iris to sale, finds solace in his close-knit group: William, who's like a brother; Margaret; Little Zander; Milton, a gifted artist; and Pandora, whose beauty calls to him.

As she delves into Melville's impulsive purchase of a Massachusetts farmhouse, his fevered revision of Moby-Dick there, his intense friendship with neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne, and his troubled marriage to Elizabeth Shaw, she becomes increasingly obsessed by what his devotion to his art reveals about cost, worth, and debt.

Her preoccupation deepens and expands, extending outward to an orbiting cast of Melvillean questers and fanatics, as well as to biographers and writers—among them Elizabeth Hardwick and Robert Lowell—whose lives resonate with Melville's. As she pulls these distant figures close, her quarantine quest ultimately becomes a midlife reckoning with her own marriage and ambition.

Absorbing, charming, and intimate, Dayswork considers the blurry lines between life and literature, the slippage between what happens and what gets recorded, and the ways we locate ourselves in the lives of others. In wry, epigrammatic prose, Bachelder and Habel have crafted an exquisite and daring novel.","During quarantine, a woman's obsession with Herman Melville's life becomes a reckoning with her own marriage and ambition.

Her regimented world is disrupted by two outsiders: Doctor Kathleen Lynn, a rumored Rebel fleeing police, and young volunteer Bridie Sweeney.

In the darkness and intensity of this tiny ward, these three women transform each other's lives over the course of three extraordinary days.

With tireless tenderness and humanity, carers and mothers alike somehow manage their impossible work.

As Tracker follows the boy's scent—from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers—he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them.

His paranormal gift—""the shining""—opened a door straight into hell, and even as an adult, the ghosts of that place and his father's legacy of alcoholism and violence kept him drifting aimlessly through life.

Now Dan has finally found purpose working at a local hospice, where he's earned the nickname ""Doctor Sleep"" by secretly using his abilities to comfort the dying and guide them toward the afterlife. But his hard-won stability crumbles when he meets twelve-year-old Abra Stone, who possesses an even more powerful manifestation of the shining.

Their connection puts both their lives in deadly peril. The True Knot—an ageless, murderous nomadic tribe that feeds on children with psychic abilities—has caught Abra's scent.

Two centuries later, famous writer Olive Llewellyn tours Earth while living on the second moon colony, a place of white stone and artificial beauty. Within her best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays violin in an airship terminal as forest trees rise around him.

When detective Gaspery-Jacques Roberts investigates an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers lives upended across time: an exiled earl's son driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home during a pandemic, and a childhood friend who has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the universe's timeline.

""The Swimmers is a slim brilliant novel about the value and beauty of mundane routines that shape our days and identities; or, maybe it's a novel about the cracks that, inevitably, will one day appear to undermine our own bodies and minds; and — who knows? — it could also be read as a grand parable about the crack in the world wrought by this pandemic . . .

Experiencing what appear to be divine visions, Frank attracts fervent disciples as he reinvents himself repeatedly, converting first to Islam, then Catholicism, while being simultaneously pilloried as a heretic and revered as the Messiah.

Frank traverses the Habsburg and Ottoman empires with throngs of followers, wreaking havoc on conventional Jewish and Christian order through scandalous rumors of secret rituals and increasingly iconoclastic beliefs. Based on a real historical figure shrouded in mystery and controversy, this story becomes the perfect canvas for Olga Tokarczuk's genius.

Narrated through multiple perspectives—those who worship Frank, those who despise him, the friend who betrays him, and the lone woman who sees his true nature—The Books of Jacob captures a world on the cusp of momentous change, searching for certainty while longing for transcendence. In a nod to Hebrew texts, the novel is uniquely paginated in reverse, from page 955 to page 1.","Tokarczuk's Nobel Prize-winning epic follows the rise and fall of Jacob Frank, a real historical figure who blazed across eighteenth-century Europe as a messianic leader, upending religious and social order.",992,,Fiction / Biographical & Autofiction,Riverhead Books,01/02/2022,Olga Tokarczuk,"Olga Tokarczuk has won the Nobel Prize in Literature and the International Booker Prize, among many other honors.

The chapters are so propulsive one doesn't even fully notice the way she's subtly deconstructing the world.

9780593133491,Long Island Compromise,,"""Were we gangsters? No. But did we know how to start a fire?""

In 1980, wealthy businessman Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway, brutalized, and held for ransom. He's returned to his family less than a week later, and the Fletchers resume their prized place in the American dream, comforted that while their money endangered them, it also assured their safety.

But nearly forty years later, nobody has gotten over anything. Carl secretly seeks closure while his wife Ruth protects his emotional health. Their three grown children are struggling: Nathan's chronic fear stalls his law career, Beamer numbs his terror through substances and excess, and Jenny has spent her life proving she's not a product of family pathology—only to embody it.

As they hover at the precipice of survival, they discover the family fortune has dwindled to nothing. They must confront how much their wealth shaped both their successes and failures.

Spanning decades and generations, Long Island Compromise winds through the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, ambition, terror of history, evil eyes, inheritance, pyramid schemes, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love that unites a family forever.","Forty years after a kidnapping shatters their suburban paradise, the Fletcher family discovers their fortune has vanished—and must reckon with how wealth shaped their trauma, their choices, and their love for each other.",464,,Fiction / Family Life,Random House,09/07/2024,Taffy Brodesser-Akner,"Taffy Brodesser-Akner is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine and author of two novels: Fleishman Is in Trouble, which she adapted into an Emmy-nominated FX limited series, and Long Island Compromise.

Imagine Me Gone follows the decades-long consequences of this act of faith. At the story's heart is their eldest son Michael, a brilliant and anxious music obsessive who navigates the world through wit and parody. His younger siblings—responsible Celia and tightly controlled Alec—join their mother in caring for Michael's increasingly precarious mental state as he inherits his father's devastating depression.

Told through alternating perspectives of all five family members, this searing novel explores the fierce love of a mother for her children, the inescapable devotion between siblings, and how one father's pain echoes through generations. Haslett's emotionally precise prose captures both the humor and heartbreak of a family bound by shared crisis, creating an unforgettable portrait of how far we'll go to save the people we love most.","From a Pulitzer finalist, a devastating family saga about inherited depression and unconditional love.

I got caught up in the beauty of Haslett's sentences and the lives of these oh-so-human people bound by shared duress and cycles of hope.

But her larger-than-life father's shocking death changes everything.

Alice plans to keep her head down, pay her final respects, and leave the minute the funeral ends. Unfortunately, her father had other plans. The eccentric, manipulative patriarch left his family a final challenge—an inheritance game designed to upend their world. The rules are clear: spend one week on the island, complete their assigned tasks, and receive the inheritance.

But a whole week on Storm Island proves no easy task. Every corner of the sprawling old house bursts with chaos: her older sister's secret love affair, her brother's unyielding arrogance, her younger sister's constant vibe analysis, her mother's cold judgment. All under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father's intriguing and too-handsome second-in-command.

As her remains are bundled into oblivion, Thomas Cromwell breakfasts with the victors. The blacksmith's son from Putney emerges from the spring's bloodbath to continue his climb to power and wealth, while his formidable master, Henry VIII, settles to short-lived happiness with his third queen.

Cromwell is a man with only his wits to rely on—no great family to back him, no private army. Despite rebellion at home, traitors plotting abroad, and threats of invasion testing Henry's regime to the breaking point, Cromwell's robust imagination sees a new country in the mirror of the future. But can a nation, or a person, shed the past like a skin? Do the dead continually unbury themselves?

With The Mirror & the Light, Hilary Mantel brings to a triumphant close the trilogy she began with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. She traces Cromwell's final years, offering a defining portrait of predator and prey, of a ferocious contest between royal will and a common man's vision of a modern nation making itself through conflict, passion, and courage.","The final volume in Mantel's Cromwell trilogy traces his rise to unparalleled power and his brutal fall.

Wandering the familiar streets, she finds herself caught between memory and uncertainty: back in New England, the family home is for sale, its contents already sorted and winnowed.

As she walks, the narrator recalls everything that made her complicated mother extraordinary—her brilliant wit, fierce generosity, maddening obstinacy, and sheer determination to seize life despite physical limitations. But she also grapples with harder questions: How did her mother endure? And does chronicling this remarkable life constitute an act of love or betrayal?

What begins as a meditation on grief becomes something deeper—an exploration of the relationship between parent and child, and ultimately, a lesson in what it means to write. McCracken has crafted a novel that is both comic and heartbreaking, examining how we honor those we've lost while respecting their privacy.

She can't imagine how waiting tables at a 24-hour pancake diner and moving in with too many weird roommates could possibly change that. And there's certainly no chance of her subway commute being anything more than a daily trudge through boredom and electrical failures.

But then, there's this gorgeous girl on the train.

Jane. Dazzling, charming, mysterious, impossible Jane. Jane with her rough edges and swoopy hair and soft smile, showing up in a leather jacket to save August's day when she needed it most. August's subway crush becomes the best part of her day, but pretty soon, she discovers there's one big problem: Jane doesn't just look like an old school punk rocker.

Set among the cities and suburbs of Florida, each story delves into the ordinary worlds of young girls, women, and men who find themselves confronted by extraordinary moments of violent personal reckoning. These intimate portraits scour and soothe, blasting light on the nature of family, faith, forgiveness, and what we may—or may not—owe one another.

A thirteen-year-old meditates on her sadness when unexpected tragedy strikes. A woman recovering from miscarriage finds herself unable to let go of her daughter, whose body parts she sees throughout daily life. A teenager resists her family's church and is accused of courting the devil. Servers at a supper club cater to the insatiable cravings of wealthy clientele.

While not memoir, the book carries deeply personal connections to Mott's own experiences, exploding with surreal moments—time travel, sea monster sightings, peacocks appearing without warning, and feelings of love and memory so vivid they ache.

Two Black writers navigate a world torn by gun violence, each seeking peace and belonging. One travels the globe on a book tour after winning a major literary prize; the other prepares to speak at a school recovering from a shooting. As their storylines converge, truth and absurdity dance together in equal measure.

Characters drink booze from award trophies while menaces lurk in shadows.

He has a good flat with his sister Greta, a solid career where his colleagues only occasionally remind him that he's the sole Māori person in the office, and a good friend he only sleeps with when he's sad. But when work sends him to Argentina and throws him back into his former lover's orbit, Valdin is forced to confront the feelings he's been trying to ignore—and the future he wants.

Greta is not letting her painfully unrequited crush get her down (or her possibly pointless master's thesis, or her pathetic academic salary). She'd love to focus on the charming fellow grad student she meets at a party and her friendships with a circle of similarly floundering twenty-somethings, but her chaotic family life won't stop intruding: her mother is keeping secrets, her nephew is having a gay crisis, and her brother has suddenly flown to South America without a word.

This is a gripping, mythic, bone-pulverizing descent into the grim darkness of American slavery—and yet somehow this novel simultaneously leaves you in awe of the human capacity to not only endure, but to ascend back to the light. A spectacular achievement.""

—Anthony Doerr, author of Cloud Cuckoo Land & All The Light We Cannot See

""Overwhelming . . . This is a novel of triumph. . . . Running up against the limits of faith in the face of calamity, Annis eventually hammers out a relationship to the spirit world, complete with a rough-hewn existential philosophy that is both revolutionary and entirely consistent with the tools at her disposal.""

9780374609078,Palaver,,"In Tokyo, a son works as an English tutor, drinking his nights away with friends at a gay bar. He's entangled in a sexual relationship with a married man, and while he has built a chosen family in Japan, he remains estranged from his family in Houston—particularly his mother, whose preference for his oft-troubled, homophobic brother pushed him to leave home.

Then, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, ten years since they've last seen each other, his mother arrives uninvited on his doorstep.

Separated only by the son's cat, the two bristle against each other immediately. The mother wrestles with memories of her youth in Jamaica and her own complicated brother, working to reconcile good intentions with past missteps. The son struggles to forgive. But as life steers them in unexpected directions—the mother toward a tentative friendship with a local bistro owner, the son cautiously getting to know a new patron at the bar—they begin to see each other more clearly.

Sharing meals, conversations, and an eventful trip to Nara, mother and son try their best to define where ""home"" really is, and whether they can find it in each other. Moving through past and present across Houston, Jamaica, and Japan, Washington's Palaver is an intricate story of family, love, and the beauty of a life among others.",Ten years of silence end when a mother shows up uninvited at her estranged son's Tokyo apartment.

Both lonely and awkward, they strike up an unexpected connection that sparks romance and creativity.

Together, they create an unsigned poster featuring an enigmatic phrase: ""The edge is a shantytown filled with gold seekers. We are fugitives, and the law is skinny with hunger for us."" The mysterious posters begin appearing everywhere, captivating anyone who sees them. But as rumors spread—Satanists, kidnappers—the town erupts into panic, and their art threatens to tear them apart.

Twenty years later, Frances Eleanor Budge is now a famous author with a loving family and carefully constructed life. Then journalist Mazzy Brower calls about the Coalfield Panic of 1996, threatening to unravel everything Frances has built.

Written with Wilson's trademark wit and blazing prose, this nuanced exploration of young love, identity, and art's power examines the secrets that haunt us and what truth ultimately sets free.","Two misfit teenagers create mysterious art that sends their small Tennessee town into a panic.

9780061579035,The Family Fang,,"Mr. and Mrs. Fang called it art. Their children called it mischief.

Performance artists Caleb and Camille Fang dedicated themselves to making great art. But when an artist's work lies in subverting normality, it can be difficult to raise well-adjusted children. Just ask Buster and Annie Fang. For as long as they can remember, they starred unwillingly in their parents' madcap pieces, growing up in the fishbowl of their parents' strange world.

Now that they're adults, the chaos of their childhood has made it difficult to cope with life outside their family's bizarre universe. When the lives they've built come crashing down, brother and sister have nowhere to go but home, where they discover that Caleb and Camille are planning one last performance—their magnum opus—whether the kids agree to participate or not.

Soon, ambition breeds conflict, bringing the Fangs to face the difficult decision about what's ultimately more important: their family or their art. Filled with Wilson's endless creativity, vibrant prose, and sharp humor, The Family Fang is a masterfully executed tale that is as bizarre as it is touching.","Two adult siblings return home to find their performance artist parents planning one final art piece.

Is it genuine or is it yet another Fang performance piece? Early on in the novel, we're told that the strange art the Fangs create has been glowingly described by critics as ""choreographed spontaneity."" Wilson might as well have been writing a review for his own strange and wonderful novel, for The Family Fang indeed reads as a work of ""choreographed spontaneity"" that will linger in your mind long after the mall has closed and the mess in the restaurant has been cleaned up.""
